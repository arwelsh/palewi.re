   "author": 1, 
   "body_html": "<p>So here's the situation. You've got a <a href=\"http://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django</a> app that uses the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/maps/\">Google Maps API</a>. \r\n\tAnd you want to deploy the HTML across multiple domains&mdash;like development, staging and production environments.\r\n\t</p>\n<p>Typically, you call Google's Mapping API with your registered API key.</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"nt\">&lt;script </span><span class=\"na\">src=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?file=api&amp;amp;v=2&amp;amp;key=ABQIAAAAE7jH76TvSwj2EbGtTFztGBSZQPaKzcJUNBmscSu8lUTMp7T2MxRd9I3aSZGU4Qk1Ibht_Cu0cZYCqQ&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>But, in this scenario, each of your domains may require a different Google API key. \r\n\tWhich means you can't just paste the key directly into your HTML template and use it\r\n\tacross the board, because it will only work for the one domain where it's registered.\r\n</p>\n<p>Here's my workaround. Create a <a href=\"http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2006/jun/14/django-tips-template-context-processors/\">\r\n\tcontext processor</a> that will dynamically select your API key depending on the domain, and \r\n\tautomatically pump it into your template so it's always ready for you to call. \r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>So, instead of pasting in the whole key, like we did above.

I felt like a genie liberated from its bottle. The energy of my spirit seemed to flow like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria. Finer than the finest pleasures we can experience as physical beings, this absence of physical boundary was one of glorious bliss. As my consciousness dwelled in a flow of sweet tranquility, it was obvious to me that I would never be able to squeeze the enormousness of my spirit back inside this tiny cellular matrix.

Instead of having my moments prematurely stunted, they became open-ended, and I felt no rush to do anything. Like walking along the beach, or just hanging out in the beauty of nature, I shifted from the doing-consciousness of my left brain to the being-consciousness of my right brain. I morphed from feeling small and isolated to feeling enormous and expansive. I stopped thinking in language and shifted to taking new pictures of what was going on in the present moment. I was not capable of deliberating about past and future-related ideas because those cells were incapacitated. All I could perceive was right here, right now, and it was beautiful.

   "body_html": "<p><a href=\"#update-one\"><strong>UPDATE I</strong></a>, <a href=\"#update-two\"><strong>UPDATE II</strong>, </a><a href=\"#update-three\"><strong>UPDATE III</strong>, </a><a href=\"#update-four\"><strong>UPDATE IV</strong> </a></p>\n<p>After <a href=\"http://twitter.com/derekwillis/status/1324229013\">Derek Willis</a> flagged the sudden absence of crime narratives in DC's public data feed last Friday, I buzzed a couple emails over to <a href=\"http://octo.dc.gov/octo/site/default.asp\">the CTO's office in DC</a>. Here's the response I received Monday morning from David Strigel, program manager of the city's data warehouse:\r\n<blockquote>Good morning Ben.  MPD stopped sending the crime narratives and they release this statement on Friday.  We will continue to work with MPD to publish the crime data and if they bring the narratives back online we will make them available.<p>\n</p><p>Revision to Crime Data Summary Information The MPD is committed to providing crime data to our community partners to keep them informed about incidents in the different neighborhoods in DC. At the same time, we are also committed to protecting the privacy of crime victims and the integrity of ongoing investigations. In an effort to balance these objectives the MPD will no longer provide narrative information associated with the crime incidents. Narrative information will be for internal use only.</p>\n<p>The following crime information will continue to be available to the public through several websites as well as through the MPD\u2019s community email discussion groups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PSA</li>\n<li>Criminal Complaint Number (CCN)</li>\n<li>Block (block address provided; specific addresses are not available)</li>\n<li>Offense</li>\n<li>Method</li>\n<li>Offense</li>\n<li>Report Date</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Individuals interested in getting additional information about a particular incident are encouraged to reach out to their police district commander, their PSA lieutenant, or to attend one of their monthly PSA-Community meetings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</p><p>As the RCFP and others have documented in the past, <a href=\"http://www.rcfp.org/newsitems/index.php?i=6058\">privacy is one of the top reasons</a> that government agencies seek to withhold information. But why this data field and why now? Looking at the narratives that have been previously published can we see anything that presents a convincing case for withholding the information? Some recent examples include:</p>\n<blockquote><p>R-1REPORTS FOR C-1 THAT UNKNOWN SUBJECTS SMASHED OUT THE PASSENGER WINDOW AND ATTEMPTED TO STEAL THE LISTED PROPERTY FROM THE LISTED AUTO.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>C1 REPORTS CLOSING HIS BUSINESS FOR THE NIGHT WHEN HE OBSERVED S1 URINATING IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING. C1 CONFRONTED S1 AND TOLD HIM TO STOP AND LEAVE THE AREA. S1 STATED WHAT''S THE PROBLEM? AND WALKED TO THE SIDE OF C1''S BUSINESS AND AGAIN STARTED</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>C1 REPORTS THAT AFTER A VERBAL AND PHYSICAL ALTERCATION WITH S1, THAT S1 STABBED C1 CAUSING THE LISTED INJURY. S1 FLED THE LOCATION IN AN UNKNOWN DIRECTION AND MANNER.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Have there been any real world examples of the narratives being used to identify a crime victim's identity against their will? What law is being cited as justification? And who made this decision exactly? David Strigel is hanging it on the police, who I'll be sending an annoying email shortly, but if you'd like to complain to him anyway, his personally identifying email is <a href=\"mailto:David.Strigel@dc.gov\">David.Strigel@dc.gov</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"update-one\">UPDATE I</a></strong>: After hearing back from OCTO this morning, I got on the phone with the MPD and was quickly directed by several sources to Kaylin Castelli, <a href=\"mailto:kaylin.castelli@dc.gov\">kaylin.castelli@dc.gov,</a> the department's manager of Internet communication. I left her a voicemail expressing my interest and then followed up with an email. She very soon responded by providing another copy of the release printed above and promised to answer my specific questions soon. In response, I reiterated my specific questions, which you can find printed below, and asked when I could expect a reply.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Why was this decision taken last Friday?</li>\n<li>Who made the decision, and who else was involved in the process?</li>\n<li>What specific legal grounding is being cited?</li>\n<li>Are there any real world examples of the narrative data exposing a victim's identity?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If there's anything obvious I'm forgetting to ask, please let me know.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"update-two\">UPDATE II</a></strong>: No further communication came my direction Monday. This morning I've sent a follow-up email to Castelli reiterating my interest.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"update-three\">UPDATE III</a></strong>: Still no word from Castelli. I put in another voicemail and email Thursday morning. Sorry for being so slow, but I'm nibbling at this on the edges around a busy work day, so I'm trying to stay in the take it slow mood. And there's still time to escalate. I'm going to start working other sources and consider some public information requests if I don't get an answer today.</p>\n<p><strong><a name=\"update-four\">UPDATE IV</a></strong>: Friday morning I received the following response from Castelli, via email:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<li>Why was this decision taken last Friday? Who made the decision?</li>\n<p>The narrative information was originally brought into question early January 2009, when some detailed information was released publically on one of the district email discussion groups (aka \u201clistserv\u201d). Chief Lanier instructed the district email discussion group administrators to stop posting narrative information to ensure no personal victim information was released. At the same time, staff was instructed to investigate ways that the crime information could easily be posted to the email discussion groups while maintaining victims\u2019 privacy.</p>\n<p>Staff evaluated the process by which narratives were made public. We learned that, in order to provide \u201cclean\u201d narrative information \u2013 narratives without any victim\u2019s personal information \u2013 the narratives were first reviewed and edited by staff in the Research and Analysis Division (RAD).</p>\n<p>The remaining data pieces (all data, excluding narratives) were available through a source that required no editing. The IT staff at MPD developed an application that could easily and automatically post summary crime data to the email discussion groups, provided the narratives were not included.</p>\n<p>After evaluating the process by which narrative information was made available to the public, and after learning about the application that could automatically post the crime data information (excluding the narratives), the Chief of Police chose to provide automatic data uploads to the email discussion groups, because they quickly provided the crime information that was most important to the community members \u2013 crime incident, date range, and block-level location \u2013 and because it didn\u2019t require a person to be involved in the process on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n<p>In addition to opting for the automated posting process, the Chief of Police decided that it was inefficient for members of the RAD staff take hours out of their week to do perform the time-consuming editing, when community members could easily get that information (as well as additional public safety information) by reaching out to their district commander, and PSA lieutenants and officers.</p>\n<li>What specific legal grounding is being cited?</li>\n<p>Under FOIA there is a general privacy exemption which protects information of a personal nature where public disclosure would be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See D.C. Code 2-534 (a)(2).  Another provision provides that investigatory records compiled for law-enforcement purposes may be withheld only if release of the information would interfere with enforcement proceedings; deprive a person of a right to a fair trial; or would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See  D.C. Code 2-534 (a) (3) (A) (B) and (C).</p>\n<p>There is no legal requirement that the department provide narrative information.  The department is required to make the arrest book available for review by the public when not in actual use.  See D.C. Code 5-113.06.</p>\n<li>Are there any real world examples of the narrative data exposing a victim's identity?</li>\n<p>There have been incidents in the past when a victim name or specific address was released publically. While no one was injured in these incidents, we don\u2019t intend to wait for a tragedy to occur before we find a better solution.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well, there's an answer. Sounds like an \"it's too much work\" argument is being hung on the chief. Since all this listserv business is new to me, I submitted a few follow up questions.

   "body_markup": "<p><a href=\"#update-one\"><strong>UPDATE I</strong></a>, <a href=\"#update-two\"><strong>UPDATE II</strong>, </a><a href=\"#update-three\"><strong>UPDATE III</strong>, </a><a href=\"#update-four\"><strong>UPDATE IV</strong> </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After <a href=\"http://twitter.com/derekwillis/status/1324229013\">Derek Willis</a> flagged the sudden absence of crime narratives in DC's public data feed last Friday, I buzzed a couple emails over to <a href=\"http://octo.dc.gov/octo/site/default.asp\">the CTO's office in DC</a>. Here's the response I received Monday morning from David Strigel, program manager of the city's data warehouse:\r\n<blockquote>Good morning Ben.  MPD stopped sending the crime narratives and they release this statement on Friday.  We will continue to work with MPD to publish the crime data and if they bring the narratives back online we will make them available.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Revision to Crime Data Summary Information The MPD is committed to providing crime data to our community partners to keep them informed about incidents in the different neighborhoods in DC. At the same time, we are also committed to protecting the privacy of crime victims and the integrity of ongoing investigations. In an effort to balance these objectives the MPD will no longer provide narrative information associated with the crime incidents. Narrative information will be for internal use only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following crime information will continue to be available to the public through several websites as well as through the MPD\u2019s community email discussion groups:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>PSA</li>\r\n\t<li>Criminal Complaint Number (CCN)</li>\r\n\t<li>Block (block address provided; specific addresses are not available)</li>\r\n\t<li>Offense</li>\r\n\t<li>Method</li>\r\n\t<li>Offense</li>\r\n\t<li>Report Date</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Individuals interested in getting additional information about a particular incident are encouraged to reach out to their police district commander, their PSA lieutenant, or to attend one of their monthly PSA-Community meetings.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>As the RCFP and others have documented in the past, <a href=\"http://www.rcfp.org/newsitems/index.php?i=6058\">privacy is one of the top reasons</a> that government agencies seek to withhold information. But why this data field and why now? Looking at the narratives that have been previously published can we see anything that presents a convincing case for withholding the information? Some recent examples include:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>R-1REPORTS FOR C-1 THAT UNKNOWN SUBJECTS SMASHED OUT THE PASSENGER WINDOW AND ATTEMPTED TO STEAL THE LISTED PROPERTY FROM THE LISTED AUTO.</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>C1 REPORTS CLOSING HIS BUSINESS FOR THE NIGHT WHEN HE OBSERVED S1 URINATING IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING. C1 CONFRONTED S1 AND TOLD HIM TO STOP AND LEAVE THE AREA. S1 STATED WHAT''S THE PROBLEM? AND WALKED TO THE SIDE OF C1''S BUSINESS AND AGAIN STARTED</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>C1 REPORTS THAT AFTER A VERBAL AND PHYSICAL ALTERCATION WITH S1, THAT S1 STABBED C1 CAUSING THE LISTED INJURY. S1 FLED THE LOCATION IN AN UNKNOWN DIRECTION AND MANNER.</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Have there been any real world examples of the narratives being used to identify a crime victim's identity against their will? What law is being cited as justification? And who made this decision exactly? David Strigel is hanging it on the police, who I'll be sending an annoying email shortly, but if you'd like to complain to him anyway, his personally identifying email is <a href=\"mailto:David.Strigel@dc.gov\">David.Strigel@dc.gov</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"update-one\">UPDATE I</a></strong>: After hearing back from OCTO this morning, I got on the phone with the MPD and was quickly directed by several sources to Kaylin Castelli, <a href=\"mailto:kaylin.castelli@dc.gov\">kaylin.castelli@dc.gov,</a> the department's manager of Internet communication. I left her a voicemail expressing my interest and then followed up with an email. She very soon responded by providing another copy of the release printed above and promised to answer my specific questions soon. In response, I reiterated my specific questions, which you can find printed below, and asked when I could expect a reply.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Why was this decision taken last Friday?</li>\r\n\t<li>Who made the decision, and who else was involved in the process?</li>\r\n\t<li>What specific legal grounding is being cited?</li>\r\n\t<li>Are there any real world examples of the narrative data exposing a victim's identity?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>If there's anything obvious I'm forgetting to ask, please let me know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"update-two\">UPDATE II</a></strong>: No further communication came my direction Monday. This morning I've sent a follow-up email to Castelli reiterating my interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"update-three\">UPDATE III</a></strong>: Still no word from Castelli. I put in another voicemail and email Thursday morning. Sorry for being so slow, but I'm nibbling at this on the edges around a busy work day, so I'm trying to stay in the take it slow mood. And there's still time to escalate. I'm going to start working other sources and consider some public information requests if I don't get an answer today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a name=\"update-four\">UPDATE IV</a></strong>: Friday morning I received the following response from Castelli, via email:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<li>Why was this decision taken last Friday? Who made the decision?</li>\r\n\r\n<p>The narrative information was originally brought into question early January 2009, when some detailed information was released publically on one of the district email discussion groups (aka \u201clistserv\u201d). Chief Lanier instructed the district email discussion group administrators to stop posting narrative information to ensure no personal victim information was released. At the same time, staff was instructed to investigate ways that the crime information could easily be posted to the email discussion groups while maintaining victims\u2019 privacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staff evaluated the process by which narratives were made public. We learned that, in order to provide \u201cclean\u201d narrative information \u2013 narratives without any victim\u2019s personal information \u2013 the narratives were first reviewed and edited by staff in the Research and Analysis Division (RAD).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The remaining data pieces (all data, excluding narratives) were available through a source that required no editing. The IT staff at MPD developed an application that could easily and automatically post summary crime data to the email discussion groups, provided the narratives were not included.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After evaluating the process by which narrative information was made available to the public, and after learning about the application that could automatically post the crime data information (excluding the narratives), the Chief of Police chose to provide automatic data uploads to the email discussion groups, because they quickly provided the crime information that was most important to the community members \u2013 crime incident, date range, and block-level location \u2013 and because it didn\u2019t require a person to be involved in the process on a day-to-day basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to opting for the automated posting process, the Chief of Police decided that it was inefficient for members of the RAD staff take hours out of their week to do perform the time-consuming editing, when community members could easily get that information (as well as additional public safety information) by reaching out to their district commander, and PSA lieutenants and officers.</p>\r\n\t<li>What specific legal grounding is being cited?</li>\r\n<p>Under FOIA there is a general privacy exemption which protects information of a personal nature where public disclosure would be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See D.C. Code 2-534 (a)(2).  Another provision provides that investigatory records compiled for law-enforcement purposes may be withheld only if release of the information would interfere with enforcement proceedings; deprive a person of a right to a fair trial; or would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. See  D.C. Code 2-534 (a) (3) (A) (B) and (C).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no legal requirement that the department provide narrative information.  The department is required to make the arrest book available for review by the public when not in actual use.  See D.C. Code 5-113.06.</p>\r\n\t<li>Are there any real world examples of the narrative data exposing a victim's identity?</li>\r\n<p>There have been incidents in the past when a victim name or specific address was released publically. While no one was injured in these incidents, we don\u2019t intend to wait for a tragedy to occur before we find a better solution.</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, there's an answer. Sounds like an \"it's too much work\" argument is being hung on the chief. Since all this listserv business is new to me, I submitted a few follow up questions. They are:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>Forgive my ignorance, but can I ask what email listservs you're talking about?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And besides the Chief, what are the names of the people involved in the review? Who are the email discussion group administrators and other staff who conducted the review? Who was in charge of it? And did the review result in any kind of document or report of findings? ... Also, if possible, could you please direct me to the initial listserv incident that triggered this chain of events? And how did this issue come to chief's attention?</p></blockquote>",

   "author": 1, 
   "body_html": "<p>Nothing fancy here. A common thing I want to do with Django is publish an \"object_list\" generic view drawn out of a ForeignKey table that includes each object's total number of occurances.</p>\n<p>In English: A list with counts. Like this page reporting the occurrence of different ages in our <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/age/\">California's War Dead</a> database.</p>\n<p>There are easy enough way to gets this done in your views.py, or with a custom manager. And it's getting increasingly easy thanks <a href=\"http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3566\">the aggregates support</a> that's making it's way into Django 1.1. But, just for the hell of it, I thought I'd throw up my simple solution for these situations. It ain't the only way. But I think it's pretty easy.</p>\n<p>So, without any further whatnot, here is Ben's approximation of an auto-count field. The code is a simplification of my freshly published pluggable app, <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/django-correx/\">django-correx</a>, which you can now download from <a href=\" \t http://code.google.com/p/django-correx/\">Google Code</a> or <a href=\"http://github.com/palewire/django-correx/tree/master\">github</a>.</p>\n<p>First, in your models.py make two models with a foreign key relationship. (I'm going to keep the example very bare bones, simply for the purpose of demonstration. If you want to see my full file, check it out <a href=\"http://github.com/palewire/django-correx/blob/9978502dbd92ceb82ee8e9242f0d55da83d719dc/correx/models.py\">here</a>.)</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">django.db</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">models</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">ChangeType</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Model</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">name</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">CharField</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">max_length</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mf\">20</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">Change</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Model</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">description</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">TextField</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">change_type</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">ForeignKey</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ChangeType</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">pub_date</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">DateTimeField</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">is_public</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">BooleanField</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">default</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">False</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Okay. So that's a start. The goal here is to add the auto-count field to ChangeType and have it regularly update itself with the total number of associated changes that have been set for publication.</p>\n<p>What I like to do is add a simple IntegerField that can't be futzed with from the admin, and then attach a method that make the join to the parent table and retrieves the current count. Like so:</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"k\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">ChangeType</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Model</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">name</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">CharField</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">max_length</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mf\">20</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">change_count</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">models</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">IntegerField</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">default</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mf\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">editable</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">False</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n  <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">count_changes</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"sd\">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    Counts the total number of live changes of this type and saves the result to the `change_count` field.</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">count</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">change_set</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">filter</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">is_public</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">True</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">count</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">change_count</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">count</span>\n    <span class=\"bp\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">save</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Now all you need to do is regularly schedule the counts.

   "body_markup": "<p>Nothing fancy here. A common thing I want to do with Django is publish an \"object_list\" generic view drawn out of a ForeignKey table that includes each object's total number of occurances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In English: A list with counts. Like this page reporting the occurrence of different ages in our <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/age/\">California's War Dead</a> database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are easy enough way to gets this done in your views.py, or with a custom manager. And it's getting increasingly easy thanks <a href=\"http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3566\">the aggregates support</a> that's making it's way into Django 1.1. But, just for the hell of it, I thought I'd throw up my simple solution for these situations. It ain't the only way. But I think it's pretty easy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, without any further whatnot, here is Ben's approximation of an auto-count field. The code is a simplification of my freshly published pluggable app, <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/django-correx/\">django-correx</a>, which you can now download from <a href=\" \t http://code.google.com/p/django-correx/\">Google Code</a> or <a href=\"http://github.com/palewire/django-correx/tree/master\">github</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, in your models.py make two models with a foreign key relationship. (I'm going to keep the example very bare bones, simply for the purpose of demonstration. If you want to see my full file, check it out <a href=\"http://github.com/palewire/django-correx/blob/9978502dbd92ceb82ee8e9242f0d55da83d719dc/correx/models.py\">here</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<pre lang=\"Python\">from django.db import models\r\n\r\nclass ChangeType(models.Model):\r\n  name = models.CharField(max_length=20)\r\n\r\nclass Change(models.Model):\r\n  description = models.TextField()\r\n  change_type = models.ForeignKey(ChangeType)\r\n  pub_date = models.DateTimeField()\r\n  is_public = models.BooleanField(default=False)</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay.

   "body_html": "<h2>01. Practice news-driven development</h2>\n<p>Most data-driven news applications I've encountered follow what I would call The Chicago Crime model, a name lifted from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Holovaty\">Adrian Holovaty</a>'s famous site. Steady streams of government-provided data are repurposed into a flexible interface that allows users to compare disparate sources (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)\">\"the mashup\"</a>) and easily localize the information so it can provide particulars to a wide body of users (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail\">\"the long tail\"</a>).</p>\n<p>It's a brilliant model, the app that launched a 1,000 ships. But it's not the only way to get things done.</p>\n<p>In news terms, where minutes matter, it can still require a relatively long time to do. Especially when it comes to data acquisition. Let's face it, if you're using government data as your starting point, the idea of an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP\">SOAPy API</a> is laughable. So don't get your hopes up. Goofing around with <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/api\">delicious tags</a> or <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/services/api/\">Flickr photos</a> is fun, but if you want to do something original from the public sector, they're only going to get you so far. You're going to be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)\">FOIA'ing</a>, or, if you're lucky, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping\">scraping</a>. And then you're going to be cleaning. Especially if you're invested in serving accurate and consistant information. Because if there's a government database out there that's ready to serve, I've yet to see it.</p><p>\n</p><p>And there's usually not much of a news hook. Look, I appreciate Everyblock and Chicago Crime and that whole style. Hell, I've essentially remodeled my career to emulate them. But when you get down to it, they're essentially built around the idea that umpteen little news hooks (\"Someone was robbed in my neighborhood,\" \"A liquor store wants to open up on your block.\") will add up to something greater than the sum of their parts. That <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_news\">\"hyperlocal\"</a> or  \"long tail\" philosophy, to use the parlance of our time, may ultimately be where a lot of us end up, but blockbuster news is still happening and there's no reason all the same tools that made the Chicago Crime successful can't be used to cover the hell out of a big story when it breaks.</p>\n<p>I had just such an opportunity last Friday at the L.A. Times. Late in the afternoon, news broke that a commuter train had crashed in the Valley, potentially killing many riders on board. We didn't know how many fatalities to expect, nor how long it would take for their identities released. But we knew that our audience was going to want to know, and as soon as possible. The typical newspaper.com way to handle this sort of thing is to publish a simple list, or \"blob of text\", when it's available. And then follow up later with a scattershot of obituaries, usually released as they appear in the paper. But, when you think about it in terms of the <a href=\"http://www.holovaty.com/blog/archive/2006/09/06/0307/\">Holovaty manifesto</a> and the general concept of the Internet, there's really no reason that information couldn't be better collected and presented as a browsable database application. It's a lesson the LA Times learned earlier this year when <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fprojects.latimes.com%2Fwardead%2F&amp;ei=IWLSSMDgNImIsAPTs5HhBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFmPX42hJtdAzy-E_MApizlUKuCfQ&amp;sig2=9pSonD-GzR_CrPweqiGY9w\">our ripoff</a> of Adrian's <a href=\"http://projects.washingtonpost.com/fallen/\">Faces of the Fallen</a> concept reinvigorated the way the paper covers military casualties.</p>\n<p>It meant staying late at work on a Friday night, busting ass most of my weekend, and putting more faith in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memcached\">memcached</a> than most IT people are comfortable with, but the result was that when the government finally did cough up the fatality list we were ready to immediately publish it as a linked database that, over time, has been filled in by further reporting to include greater detail, photos, and more than 1,600 user comments, many of them extremely moving. It's a long way from perfect, but it provided some amount of public service, was way ahead of the competition and generated a pretty goodly amount of traffic along the way. The site is called <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=9&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fprojects.latimes.com%2Fmetrolink-crash%2F&amp;ei=QWPSSPmUG5KmtQPi8sDfBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGq8xaTWFwZuvgW0kHDf-teJBKJQg&amp;sig2=MeFRlF1YPn5r94yYRQcEBw\">Chatsworth Metrolink Crash</a>.</p>\n<p>That's all my long way of saying that I think big events matter and that database journalists shouldn't be afraid to dive in when they happen. Whether it's posting the location of hurricane shelters, letting people know who the hell all those superdelegates are, or connecting survivors following a disaster, there are plenty of obvious opportunities to do our thing. But it's not going to happen if we don't see taking on big news as an opportunity, anticipate things like the next hot Google search term, or have the capability to deploy very very quickly.</p>\n<p>I'm a long way from an authority on the whole deal, but I'm stumbling my way through it. And here are a couple things I've learned along the way.</p>\n<h2>02. Let last year's data be your guide.</h2>\n<p>Earlier this month, we released <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/schools/\">California Schools Guide</a>, a collection of data about public and private schools across the state, at the very moment the government lifted its embargo on this year's scores. I didn't have the newsworthy data in hand until less than 24 hours before it would be publicly released. But by developing the site in advance using the previous year's data as dummy entries, I was able to pre-script the loading of the 2008 data after only a few minor changes to the code. This meant that we were able to get our product out when the news hook dropped, at the same time as the paper was otherwise promoting <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-scores5-2008sep05,0,2098428,full.story\">an investigative story on the topic</a> and the state's propaganda arms were blasting its own message (\"Things are getting better! Trust us!\").</p>\n<h2>03. Don't Repeat Yourself, unless it saves you time.</h2>\n<p>Let me be clear. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself\">DRY</a> goal of elegence through efficiency is laudable. And, as a guiding principle for development, you probably can't get any better. It is the single point of truth. It's like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection\">natural selection</a>, except for awesomeness. But when you're on a tight deadline, and you've already got a code implementation that works, sometimes you JDFWI, Just Don't Fuck With It. Yeah, so maybe you just copied and pasted and introduced a little redundancy. And maybe your css is just a hodgepodge of div's repurposed from other apps. But it works, right? And what's more important, trimming down your code base, or getting the news out ahead of your competition?</p>\n<h2>04. Use Django's admin to your advantage.</h2>\n<p>For anyone who's already doing this stuff, it probably goes without saying, but <a href=\"http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#ref-contrib-admin\">Django's admin</a> is really great. As soon as your database models are written, you've instantly got a set of entry forms that are ready to deploy. This is incredibly useful when trying to turn around simple data apps on deadline. For instance, when it came to the Metrolink crash, I was able to get the models and admin up Friday night so that reporters on Metro desk could begin working on entry as I shifted to work on the views and templates.</p>\n<h2>05. Publish now, or perish.</h2>\n<p>You can have the greatest app in the world, but if you can't push it out the web ASAP, you're nowhere. If you're going the Chicago Crime route, this isn't as big of a deal. But if you're trying to hit the big news hook, it's utterly essential. And treating big news like you would anything else on your \"product schedule\" or \"iteration cycle\" just isn't going to be good enough. You can call it a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model\">waterfall</a>, you can call it reckless, you can call it news-driven development.</p>",

Let's face it, if you're using government data as your starting point, the idea of an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP\">SOAPy API</a> is laughable. So don't get your hopes up. Goofing around with <a href=\"http://delicious.com/help/api\">delicious tags</a> or <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/services/api/\">Flickr photos</a> is fun, but if you want to do something original from the public sector, they're only going to get you so far. You're going to be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)\">FOIA'ing</a>, or, if you're lucky, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping\">scraping</a>. And then you're going to be cleaning. Especially if you're invested in serving accurate and consistant information. Because if there's a government database out there that's ready to serve, I've yet to see it.<p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there's usually not much of a news hook. Look, I appreciate Everyblock and Chicago Crime and that whole style. Hell, I've essentially remodeled my career to emulate them. But when you get down to it, they're essentially built around the idea that umpteen little news hooks (\"Someone was robbed in my neighborhood,\" \"A liquor store wants to open up on your block.\") will add up to something greater than the sum of their parts. That <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_news\">\"hyperlocal\"</a> or  \"long tail\" philosophy, to use the parlance of our time, may ultimately be where a lot of us end up, but blockbuster news is still happening and there's no reason all the same tools that made the Chicago Crime successful can't be used to cover the hell out of a big story when it breaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had just such an opportunity last Friday at the L.A. Times. Late in the afternoon, news broke that a commuter train had crashed in the Valley, potentially killing many riders on board. We didn't know how many fatalities to expect, nor how long it would take for their identities released. But we knew that our audience was going to want to know, and as soon as possible. The typical newspaper.com way to handle this sort of thing is to publish a simple list, or \"blob of text\", when it's available. And then follow up later with a scattershot of obituaries, usually released as they appear in the paper. But, when you think about it in terms of the <a href=\"http://www.holovaty.com/blog/archive/2006/09/06/0307/\">Holovaty manifesto</a> and the general concept of the Internet, there's really no reason that information couldn't be better collected and presented as a browsable database application. It's a lesson the LA Times learned earlier this year when <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fprojects.latimes.com%2Fwardead%2F&amp;ei=IWLSSMDgNImIsAPTs5HhBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFmPX42hJtdAzy-E_MApizlUKuCfQ&amp;sig2=9pSonD-GzR_CrPweqiGY9w\">our ripoff</a> of Adrian's <a href=\"http://projects.washingtonpost.com/fallen/\">Faces of the Fallen</a> concept reinvigorated the way the paper covers military casualties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It meant staying late at work on a Friday night, busting ass most of my weekend, and putting more faith in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memcached\">memcached</a> than most IT people are comfortable with, but the result was that when the government finally did cough up the fatality list we were ready to immediately publish it as a linked database that, over time, has been filled in by further reporting to include greater detail, photos, and more than 1,600 user comments, many of them extremely moving. It's a long way from perfect, but it provided some amount of public service, was way ahead of the competition and generated a pretty goodly amount of traffic along the way. The site is called <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=9&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fprojects.latimes.com%2Fmetrolink-crash%2F&amp;ei=QWPSSPmUG5KmtQPi8sDfBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGq8xaTWFwZuvgW0kHDf-teJBKJQg&amp;sig2=MeFRlF1YPn5r94yYRQcEBw\">Chatsworth Metrolink Crash</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's all my long way of saying that I think big events matter and that database journalists shouldn't be afraid to dive in when they happen. Whether it's posting the location of hurricane shelters, letting people know who the hell all those superdelegates are, or connecting survivors following a disaster, there are plenty of obvious opportunities to do our thing. But it's not going to happen if we don't see taking on big news as an opportunity, anticipate things like the next hot Google search term, or have the capability to deploy very very quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm a long way from an authority on the whole deal, but I'm stumbling my way through it. And here are a couple things I've learned along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>02. Let last year's data be your guide.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month, we released <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/schools/\">California Schools Guide</a>, a collection of data about public and private schools across the state, at the very moment the government lifted its embargo on this year's scores. I didn't have the newsworthy data in hand until less than 24 hours before it would be publicly released. But by developing the site in advance using the previous year's data as dummy entries, I was able to pre-script the loading of the 2008 data after only a few minor changes to the code. This meant that we were able to get our product out when the news hook dropped, at the same time as the paper was otherwise promoting <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-scores5-2008sep05,0,2098428,full.story\">an investigative story on the topic</a> and the state's propaganda arms were blasting its own message (\"Things are getting better! Trust us!\").</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>03. Don't Repeat Yourself, unless it saves you time.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me be clear. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself\">DRY</a> goal of elegence through efficiency is laudable. And, as a guiding principle for development, you probably can't get any better. It is the single point of truth. It's like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection\">natural selection</a>, except for awesomeness. But when you're on a tight deadline, and you've already got a code implementation that works, sometimes you JDFWI, Just Don't Fuck With It. Yeah, so maybe you just copied and pasted and introduced a little redundancy. And maybe your css is just a hodgepodge of div's repurposed from other apps. But it works, right? And what's more important, trimming down your code base, or getting the news out ahead of your competition?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>04. Use Django's admin to your advantage.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For anyone who's already doing this stuff, it probably goes without saying, but <a href=\"http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#ref-contrib-admin\">Django's admin</a> is really great. As soon as your database models are written, you've instantly got a set of entry forms that are ready to deploy. This is incredibly useful when trying to turn around simple data apps on deadline. For instance, when it came to the Metrolink crash, I was able to get the models and admin up Friday night so that reporters on Metro desk could begin working on entry as I shifted to work on the views and templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>05. Publish now, or perish.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can have the greatest app in the world, but if you can't push it out the web ASAP, you're nowhere. If you're going the Chicago Crime route, this isn't as big of a deal. But if you're trying to hit the big news hook, it's utterly essential. And treating big news like you would anything else on your \"product schedule\" or \"iteration cycle\" just isn't going to be good enough. You can call it a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model\">waterfall</a>, you can call it reckless, you can call it news-driven development.</p>",

They kept nearly $1.4 billion -- about 54 cents of every dollar raised.</blockquote>\n<p>As part of our effort to package the story for the Web, I worked with <em>Times</em> staff to publish all of the records collected for analysis as an online database. What we came up with allows readers to look up the track record of individual charities, browse charities of similar types, and quickly seek out the most and least efficient charities using a goofball visualization I cooked up with our graphics guy, <a href=\"http://www.studioburbank.com/\">Thomas Lauder</a>. You can check it out <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-charity-search-home,0,7128706.htmlstory\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The app was pulled together using <a href=\"http://www.caspio.com/\">Caspio</a>, a browser-based program for building data-driven web applications. While it is technically true, as the site claims, that developing a working Caspio app requires \"no more programming,\" my experience has been that you're going to have to invest a significant amount of time hacking at its kludgey GUI to come up with something half-way decent. Whether you want to invest your time doing that, or mastering a more robust development option, is entirely up to you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tubotu.com/?p=43\">Other</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.thescoop.org/archives/2008/06/29/caspios-lessons/\">smarter</a> <a href=\"http://blog.thescoop.org/archives/2007/12/07/trial-by-caspio/\">people</a> have invested a goodly amount of space to explaining Caspio's deficiencies, so I'll leave that to <a href=\"http://commonsensej.blogspot.com/2007/10/caspio-dustup.html\">the</a> <a href=\"http://www.jacobian.org/writing/2007/sep/12/db-journalism/\">links</a>. Instead let's break out below a couple tricks that helped me at least marginally improve today's product, in hopes they might be useful to somebody. (Though I suppose any \"improvement\" is a matter of opinion! Let me know what I fucked up.)</p>\n<h2>Hack 01: Roll your own forms</h2>\n<p>Caspio offers several templates. The one I use most often is the \"search-and-result\" set. It accepts a user's input and returns any matching values. Might sound complicated, but it's the same thing as Google. You pop something in, and you get back any hits. You can examine specimens in the wild <a href=\"http://dunes.cincinnati.com/data/crime/fbi/\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tbo.com/news/reports/foreclosures/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/news/datacenter/babynames.html\">here</a>. (Thorough readers will notice that, at least at the time of writing, the Cincinnati app is dead on arrival, bearing only the cryptic message \"<a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/images/dead-caspio-cropped.png\">DataPage does not exist. (Caspio Bridge error) (50501)</a>.\")</p>\n<p>Since the \"search\" and \"result\" sides of the app are glued together in a single panel, the search box can't be very easily plugged in around your site. You'll have to find a way to make Caspio's gunky JavaScript code work in each and every location where you want to encourage user input. The result is that most Caspio apps -- including all three linked above -- tend to live in backwater, standalone pages, lampooned by Matt Waite as \"<a href=\"http://www.mattwaite.com/2008/01/02/data-ghettos/\">data ghettos</a>.\" (Personally, I prefer \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ4EVnAxHIc\">Ghettos of the Mind</a>.\")</p>\n<p>That might be acceptable if you're looking to make a destination page for your corporate intranet, like an employee directory. But it's just not good enough for news Web sites, which draw a huge share of their incoming traffic on the homepage and the first page of featured stories. If your database isn't prominently displayed there -- and it isn't unless you've got a search box or other entry point gaping open on the page -- you've losing a whole lot of potential traffic. I think there's something to be said for a \"data central\" section, but you're probably giving up a lot of clicks if you're waiting for people to hit the vague looking \"data\" link in your left-nav bar.</p>\n<p>So what's the hack? It's pretty simple. Just build a search-and-result box without a search, which you then provide with your own custom HTML. You can then reuse the search box anywhere you want: the frontpage, right-rail, story-level reefer or -- heaven forfend -- standalone \"data ghetto.\"</p>\n<p>Here's how you do it, shot by shot.</p>\n<img src=\"http://www.palewire.com/images/form-step1.png\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>First turn on the advanced options and allow parameters.</p>\n<img src=\"http://www.palewire.com/images/form-step2.png\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>Tell Caspio it should look for an external parameter in the URL, rather than use it's native search form.</p>\n<img src=\"http://www.palewire.com/images/form-step3.png\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>Tell it which field it should run the inputs against. In this case, we're building a search on a data table's \"name\" field.</p>\n<img src=\"http://www.palewire.com/images/form-step4a.png\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>Now instruct Caspio to look for the user input after a query string variable called \"name,\" and to evaluate it against the data table using \"contains\" style matching, as opposed to \"exact\" or \"starts with\" matching. If you were using a unique identifer like a primary key for the lookup (as you likely would if you were building a dropdown menu rather than a search box), you would probably want to use an \"exact\" match instead of \"contains.\"</p>\n<img src=\"http://www.palewire.com/images/form-step4b.png\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>Then finish up by telling Caspio how to handle what to do with blank variables or circumstances where you don't have a match.</p>\n<p>Now you should deploy the Caspio app as you normally would, and then craft an HTML form on a different page that points to its location, placing the user's input in the query string. For example, the search box in our charity app looks like this, with all the styling removed:</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"nt\">&lt;form</span> <span class=\"na\">action=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-charity-search-name,0,5949050.htmlstory&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">method=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;get&quot;</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;input</span> <span class=\"na\">maxlength=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;100&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">name=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;name&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">size=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;6&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;text&quot;</span> <span class=\"nt\">/&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;input</span> <span class=\"na\">type=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;submit&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">value=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;Go&quot;</span> <span class=\"nt\">/&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/form&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>That'll send people to the following link, where they'll see the search results as they're formatted by the Caspio GUI.</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-charity-search-name,0,5949050.htmlstory?name=Red Cross\n</pre></div>\n\n<h2>Hack 02: Permalinks for easy deep linking</h2>\n<p>An added benefit of using Hack 01 is that your results pages can have permalinks, albeit long and ugly ones. The link above will always call up the results for a search of \"Red Cross,\" and if you build all your drilldown pages this way, using a primary key as the external parameter, they'll each have a distinct URL. That came in handy with the charity story because it allowed me to deep link charity names and types from <a href=\"http://http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-charity6-2008jul06,0,6668563.story\">the story</a> down into the database (ex. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-charity-search-detail,0,922401.htmlstory?CharityCode=713\">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> and <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-charity-search-type,0,4633762.htmlstory?TypeCode=18\">disaster relief</a>)</p>\n<h2>Hack 03: Low-rent data visualization as a novel entry point</h2>\n<p>Once you set up the query string, there's no reason that your custom entry point must be an HTML form. My editors wanted to group the charities by their fundraising efficiency and give readers the chance to look at them group by group (i.e. which are the best, average, worst, <em>et cetera</em>.) We could have made a dropdown box, ordered list or sortable table. But the idea Thomas Lauder and I hatched instead was an interactive grid modeled on the <a href=\"http://mutualfunds.about.com/od/mutualfunds101/fr/stylebox.htm\">Morningstar Style Box</a> that sorts charities by the size and efficiency of their fundraising efforts. I built it with <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/imagemap\">an old A List Apart trick</a> so that each square links to the list of charities in its category. Take a look at it <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-charity-search-home,0,7128706.htmlstory\">here</a>. We also made a smaller version, currently on the site's frontpage and in a story-level reefer. Here's a hideous screenshot to prove it. You'll have to go to <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-charity6-2008jul06,0,6668563.story\">the site</a> if you actually want to play with it.</p>\n<img src=\"http://www.palewire.com/images/mini-grid.png\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>Alright, I've got a few more up my sleeve, but that's probably enough for now. Per usual, far be it from me to say that these methods are the only or most efficient way to solutions. They're just the ones I got done on deadline. Feel free to tell me where I screwed up, or how I can do it better next time.</p>",

Whether you want to invest your time doing that, or mastering a more robust development option, is entirely up to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tubotu.com/?p=43\">Other</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.thescoop.org/archives/2008/06/29/caspios-lessons/\">smarter</a> <a href=\"http://blog.thescoop.org/archives/2007/12/07/trial-by-caspio/\">people</a> have invested a goodly amount of space to explaining Caspio's deficiencies, so I'll leave that to <a href=\"http://commonsensej.blogspot.com/2007/10/caspio-dustup.html\">the</a> <a href=\"http://www.jacobian.org/writing/2007/sep/12/db-journalism/\">links</a>. Instead let's break out below a couple tricks that helped me at least marginally improve today's product, in hopes they might be useful to somebody. (Though I suppose any \"improvement\" is a matter of opinion! Let me know what I fucked up.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hack 01: Roll your own forms</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Caspio offers several templates. The one I use most often is the \"search-and-result\" set. It accepts a user's input and returns any matching values. Might sound complicated, but it's the same thing as Google. You pop something in, and you get back any hits. You can examine specimens in the wild <a href=\"http://dunes.cincinnati.com/data/crime/fbi/\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tbo.com/news/reports/foreclosures/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/news/datacenter/babynames.html\">here</a>. (Thorough readers will notice that, at least at the time of writing, the Cincinnati app is dead on arrival, bearing only the cryptic message \"<a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/images/dead-caspio-cropped.png\">DataPage does not exist. (Caspio Bridge error) (50501)</a>.\")</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the \"search\" and \"result\" sides of the app are glued together in a single panel, the search box can't be very easily plugged in around your site. You'll have to find a way to make Caspio's gunky JavaScript code work in each and every location where you want to encourage user input. The result is that most Caspio apps -- including all three linked above -- tend to live in backwater, standalone pages, lampooned by Matt Waite as \"<a href=\"http://www.mattwaite.com/2008/01/02/data-ghettos/\">data ghettos</a>.\" (Personally, I prefer \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ4EVnAxHIc\">Ghettos of the Mind</a>.\")</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might be acceptable if you're looking to make a destination page for your corporate intranet, like an employee directory. But it's just not good enough for news Web sites, which draw a huge share of their incoming traffic on the homepage and the first page of featured stories. If your database isn't prominently displayed there -- and it isn't unless you've got a search box or other entry point gaping open on the page -- you've losing a whole lot of potential traffic. I think there's something to be said for a \"data central\" section, but you're probably giving up a lot of clicks if you're waiting for people to hit the vague looking \"data\" link in your left-nav bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what's the hack? It's pretty simple. Just build a search-and-result box without a search, which you then provide with your own custom HTML. You can then reuse the search box anywhere you want: the frontpage, right-rail, story-level reefer or -- heaven forfend -- standalone \"data ghetto.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here's how you do it, shot by shot.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http://www.palewire.com/images/form-step1.png\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>First turn on the advanced options and allow parameters.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http://www.palewire.com/images/form-step2.png\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Tell Caspio it should look for an external parameter in the URL, rather than use it's native search form.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http://www.palewire.com/images/form-step3.png\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Tell it which field it should run the inputs against. In this case, we're building a search on a data table's \"name\" field.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http://www.palewire.com/images/form-step4a.png\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now instruct Caspio to look for the user input after a query string variable called \"name,\" and to evaluate it against the data table using \"contains\" style matching, as opposed to \"exact\" or \"starts with\" matching. If you were using a unique identifer like a primary key for the lookup (as you likely would if you were building a dropdown menu rather than a search box), you would probably want to use an \"exact\" match instead of \"contains.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http://www.palewire.com/images/form-step4b.png\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Then finish up by telling Caspio how to handle what to do with blank variables or circumstances where you don't have a match.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you should deploy the Caspio app as you normally would, and then craft an HTML form on a different page that points to its location, placing the user's input in the query string. For example, the search box in our charity app looks like this, with all the styling removed:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"HTML\"><form action=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-charity-search-name,0,5949050.htmlstory\" method=\"get\">\n\n<input maxlength=\"100\" name=\"name\" size=\"6\" type=\"text\" />\n\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Go\" />\n\n</form>\n\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>That'll send people to the following link, where they'll see the search results as they're formatted by the Caspio GUI.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"HTML\">http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-charity-search-name,0,5949050.htmlstory?name=Red Cross</pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hack 02: Permalinks for easy deep linking</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An added benefit of using Hack 01 is that your results pages can have permalinks, albeit long and ugly ones. The link above will always call up the results for a search of \"Red Cross,\" and if you build all your drilldown pages this way, using a primary key as the external parameter, they'll each have a distinct URL. That came in handy with the charity story because it allowed me to deep link charity names and types from <a href=\"http://http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-charity6-2008jul06,0,6668563.story\">the story</a> down into the database (ex. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-charity-search-detail,0,922401.htmlstory?CharityCode=713\">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> and <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-charity-search-type,0,4633762.htmlstory?TypeCode=18\">disaster relief</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hack 03: Low-rent data visualization as a novel entry point</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you set up the query string, there's no reason that your custom entry point must be an HTML form. My editors wanted to group the charities by their fundraising efficiency and give readers the chance to look at them group by group (i.e. which are the best, average, worst, <em>et cetera</em>.) We could have made a dropdown box, ordered list or sortable table. But the idea Thomas Lauder and I hatched instead was an interactive grid modeled on the <a href=\"http://mutualfunds.about.com/od/mutualfunds101/fr/stylebox.htm\">Morningstar Style Box</a> that sorts charities by the size and efficiency of their fundraising efforts. I built it with <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/imagemap\">an old A List Apart trick</a> so that each square links to the list of charities in its category. Take a look at it <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-charity-search-home,0,7128706.htmlstory\">here</a>. We also made a smaller version, currently on the site's frontpage and in a story-level reefer. Here's a hideous screenshot to prove it. You'll have to go to <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-charity6-2008jul06,0,6668563.story\">the site</a> if you actually want to play with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http://www.palewire.com/images/mini-grid.png\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, I've got a few more up my sleeve, but that's probably enough for now. Per usual, far be it from me to say that these methods are the only or most efficient way to solutions. They're just the ones I got done on deadline. Feel free to tell me where I screwed up, or how I can do it better next time.</p>",

   "title": "Terminal Recipe: Download an entire Web site with wget.", 
   "author": 1, 
   "body_html": "<p>From time to time, an occasion might arise when you'd like to download an entire Web site. At my old job, I liked to pull down government sites and go on fishing expeditions with Google Desktop Search for hot terms (ex. names of corporations and political appointees) or certain file types (ex. Excel, Access, CSV, et cetera). And the other day at my current job <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/la-me-kozinski12-2008jun12,0,778115.story\">a situation</a> cropped up where the newsroom wanted to download a bunch of files quickly, so it was handy to set a spider loose rather than sit there and try to download everything click by click.</p>\n<p>One way to handle the job is to use a command-line utility called <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/\">wget</a> to crawl your target and mirror its files on your local computer.</p>\n<p>If you're working on a Macbook, the first thing you'll need to do is install wget. I'd suggest you do that by downloading the latest version and compiling the binary from the source code. That might sound scary, but it's just a fancy way of saying you're going to install something from the command line instead of clicking a bunch of pretty boxes. Some other sites are going to push you toward pretty boxes and maybe even this big bloated thing called Fink, but, trust me on this one, it's going to be a lot easier for you down the road if you learn how to install stuff yourself. And this is a simple enough example that it's worth the shot.</p>\n<p>So, if you're with me, before you do anything else, download and install <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/\">Mac's XCode</a>, which includes the compilers you'll need to build stuff on your own.</p>\n<p>Then just open your terminal and let rip with the following...</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>mkdir src\n<span class=\"nb\">cd </span>src\ncurl -O http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-latest.tar.gz\ntar xvfz wget-latest.tar.gz\n<span class=\"nb\">cd </span>wget-1.11.3\n./configure\nsudo make install\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>You've just compiled your first program. We just made a new directory for storing source code, downloaded wget's source, unzipped it, and then \"made\" the file with our XCode compiler. Pretty easy, right? The only catch is that you'll need your computer's administrator password to run the \"sudo\" command that will create wget's binary in your system folder.</p>\n<p>In the future, that configure/make part is going to be the same for most of the source code you run into. When you encounter a new batch, just check the INSTALL or README docs where they'll usually let you know if there's anything else fancy you need to do.</p>\n<p>Now test it out by hammering in the following...</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>wget\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>And there's your new utility, waiting to run things down on your behalf. Check out how it easy it is. Want to mirror a Web site?

   "body_markup": "<p>From time to time, an occasion might arise when you'd like to download an entire Web site. At my old job, I liked to pull down government sites and go on fishing expeditions with Google Desktop Search for hot terms (ex. names of corporations and political appointees) or certain file types (ex. Excel, Access, CSV, et cetera). And the other day at my current job <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/la-me-kozinski12-2008jun12,0,778115.story\">a situation</a> cropped up where the newsroom wanted to download a bunch of files quickly, so it was handy to set a spider loose rather than sit there and try to download everything click by click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to handle the job is to use a command-line utility called <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/\">wget</a> to crawl your target and mirror its files on your local computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're working on a Macbook, the first thing you'll need to do is install wget. I'd suggest you do that by downloading the latest version and compiling the binary from the source code. That might sound scary, but it's just a fancy way of saying you're going to install something from the command line instead of clicking a bunch of pretty boxes. Some other sites are going to push you toward pretty boxes and maybe even this big bloated thing called Fink, but, trust me on this one, it's going to be a lot easier for you down the road if you learn how to install stuff yourself. And this is a simple enough example that it's worth the shot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you're with me, before you do anything else, download and install <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/\">Mac's XCode</a>, which includes the compilers you'll need to build stuff on your own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then just open your terminal and let rip with the following...</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">mkdir src\n\ncd src\n\ncurl -O http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-latest.tar.gz\n\ntar xvfz wget-latest.tar.gz\n\ncd wget-1.11.3\n\n./configure\n\nsudo make install</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>You've just compiled your first program. We just made a new directory for storing source code, downloaded wget's source, unzipped it, and then \"made\" the file with our XCode compiler. Pretty easy, right? The only catch is that you'll need your computer's administrator password to run the \"sudo\" command that will create wget's binary in your system folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, that configure/make part is going to be the same for most of the source code you run into. When you encounter a new batch, just check the INSTALL or README docs where they'll usually let you know if there's anything else fancy you need to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now test it out by hammering in the following...</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">wget</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And there's your new utility, waiting to run things down on your behalf. Check out how it easy it is. Want to mirror a Web site? Here's all you need to type...</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">wget -mk http://www.foo.com</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Blammo, you're off to the races, walking your target's directory structure and saving all the files to your hard drive. The -m option puts wget in mirror mode and the -k option will convert all the hyperlinks so they're suitable for local viewing. Then you just feed it the URL you're after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're a Linux or Windows user, the command should be the same.  If you're a Windows user, you can try it with a release like <a href=\"http://users.ugent.be/~bpuype/wget/\">this one</a>.

   "author": 1, 
   "body_html": "<p>This Memorial Day weekend marked the formal launch of <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/\">California's War Dead</a>, our database of the state's casualties from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It's the result of a lot of hard work by many people at the paper, a large share of which had already been carried through the years by our many obituary writers.</p>\n<p>The site intends to allow users to explore the data using a variety of criteria (for example, you can quickly look up fallen troops by <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/hometown\">hometown</a>, <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/high-school/\">high school</a> or <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/marital-status/\">marital status</a>). And to learn more about individuals by reading their obituaries from our back archives. Choice quotes have been selected to \"pop\" out of the individual profile pages and visitors are encouraged to leave memories and thoughts as comments.</p>\n<p>Besides all my coworkers who pitched in to make this happen on a tight deadline, thank yous should be extended to all the great developers in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.djangoproject.com%2F&amp;ei=YCo7SN7vJpGqsAOzmvW2DQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGfxYhHSLrgk6aVrm5Bbc2ozc89rA&amp;sig2=Qb22Q47-imtI1Y6zxu-gFA\">the Django community</a>. They not only provided the Web programming tools that made this idea possible, but also the <a href=\"http://holovaty.com/blog/archive/2006/09/06/0307/\">leadership</a> that showed me how the tools can be used to make journalism <em>for</em> the Web, not just <em>on</em> the Web. The same goes for all the people in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nicar.org%2F&amp;ei=ZSs7SKncIZmIsAPhnv27DQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFv1OMXDU_2U5mOn6I-DfJcHnfT7Q&amp;sig2=It6TrOcpwh1486leIvWaAw\">the NICAR community</a> who, by leading by example, have pushed me to keep learning new things and have the courage to take chances outside of journalism's well worn comfort zones. Personally, I just hope that first group can forgive me for ripping off their ideas and that the second group doesn't resent my getting the opportunity to do things like this without having to put in the once requisite 5 to 10 years on the cops-and-courts beat.</p>\n<p>If you're stretched for time, or maybe doubting there's anything new to be learned about the war, let me promote a couple spots that might interest you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over the course of assembling the data, I was surprised to learn how many immigrants to California have died. It's more than fifty, from Mexico and the Phillipines and South Korea and a number of other places. Check out the lists <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/country-of-birth/mexico/\">here</a>. A fascinating story is of Sgt. Rafael Peralta of San Diego, who enlisted the same day he received his Green Card and died in Fallouja, Iraq, when he sacrificed himself to save his compatriots from a grenade attack. His profile is <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/name/rafael-peralta/\">here</a> and the story of his heroic death is <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/06/local/me-marine6\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>The most rewarding part of the project for me has been to see how quickly we're getting great, thoughtful comments submitted by friends and family members of the deceased. One of my goals in the design was to give their writing equal footing with our previous reporting. It can be heartbreaking to read, but I'm proud to have helped make something that people think is worthy of such sensitive information. Examples I find particularly moving are the memories shared by the family of <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/name/jason-j-buzzard/\">Sgt. Jason J. Buzzard</a> of Ukiah and <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/name/christopher-d-leon/\">Corporal Christopher D. Leon</a> of Lancaster, who I'm honored to know better now than I did before our commentors contributed.</li>\n<li>It seems natural to expect that spending so much time with casualty data would have a numbing effect. But I think that's only the case when we let the very real people we've lost remain numbers in a casualty count or unknown names on a page. It's the stories that bring them to life, and my experience has been that the more stories you hear, the less numb you feel. The pain is in the details. A moving example is <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2007/02/16/local/me-daily16\">Teresa Watanabe's obituary</a> of <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/name/mark-j-daily/\">Lt. Mark J. Daily</a> of Irvine, who was inspired to join the war by the political writing of war advocate Christopher Hitchens. Hitchens has since gone to write a moving response to learning of Daily's readership, and sacrifice, that you can find <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2007/11/hitchens200711\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Finally, I'd suggest checking out <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/video/?autoStart=true&amp;topVideoCatNo=default&amp;clipId=2521929\">the video of California's Riverside Cemetery</a> by the LAT's Saatchi Cunningham. Riverside is home to dozens of veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, the top resting place in the state.</li>\n</ul>",

It's the result of a lot of hard work by many people at the paper, a large share of which had already been carried through the years by our many obituary writers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The site intends to allow users to explore the data using a variety of criteria (for example, you can quickly look up fallen troops by <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/hometown\">hometown</a>, <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/high-school/\">high school</a> or <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/marital-status/\">marital status</a>). And to learn more about individuals by reading their obituaries from our back archives. Choice quotes have been selected to \"pop\" out of the individual profile pages and visitors are encouraged to leave memories and thoughts as comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides all my coworkers who pitched in to make this happen on a tight deadline, thank yous should be extended to all the great developers in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.djangoproject.com%2F&amp;ei=YCo7SN7vJpGqsAOzmvW2DQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGfxYhHSLrgk6aVrm5Bbc2ozc89rA&amp;sig2=Qb22Q47-imtI1Y6zxu-gFA\">the Django community</a>. They not only provided the Web programming tools that made this idea possible, but also the <a href=\"http://holovaty.com/blog/archive/2006/09/06/0307/\">leadership</a> that showed me how the tools can be used to make journalism <em>for</em> the Web, not just <em>on</em> the Web. The same goes for all the people in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nicar.org%2F&amp;ei=ZSs7SKncIZmIsAPhnv27DQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFv1OMXDU_2U5mOn6I-DfJcHnfT7Q&amp;sig2=It6TrOcpwh1486leIvWaAw\">the NICAR community</a> who, by leading by example, have pushed me to keep learning new things and have the courage to take chances outside of journalism's well worn comfort zones. Personally, I just hope that first group can forgive me for ripping off their ideas and that the second group doesn't resent my getting the opportunity to do things like this without having to put in the once requisite 5 to 10 years on the cops-and-courts beat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're stretched for time, or maybe doubting there's anything new to be learned about the war, let me promote a couple spots that might interest you.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n\t<li>Over the course of assembling the data, I was surprised to learn how many immigrants to California have died. It's more than fifty, from Mexico and the Phillipines and South Korea and a number of other places. Check out the lists <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/country-of-birth/mexico/\">here</a>. A fascinating story is of Sgt. Rafael Peralta of San Diego, who enlisted the same day he received his Green Card and died in Fallouja, Iraq, when he sacrificed himself to save his compatriots from a grenade attack. His profile is <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/name/rafael-peralta/\">here</a> and the story of his heroic death is <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/06/local/me-marine6\">here</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n\t<li>The most rewarding part of the project for me has been to see how quickly we're getting great, thoughtful comments submitted by friends and family members of the deceased. One of my goals in the design was to give their writing equal footing with our previous reporting. It can be heartbreaking to read, but I'm proud to have helped make something that people think is worthy of such sensitive information. Examples I find particularly moving are the memories shared by the family of <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/name/jason-j-buzzard/\">Sgt. Jason J. Buzzard</a> of Ukiah and <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/name/christopher-d-leon/\">Corporal Christopher D. Leon</a> of Lancaster, who I'm honored to know better now than I did before our commentors contributed.</li>\n\n\n\n\t<li>It seems natural to expect that spending so much time with casualty data would have a numbing effect. But I think that's only the case when we let the very real people we've lost remain numbers in a casualty count or unknown names on a page. It's the stories that bring them to life, and my experience has been that the more stories you hear, the less numb you feel. The pain is in the details. A moving example is <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2007/02/16/local/me-daily16\">Teresa Watanabe's obituary</a> of <a href=\"http://projects.latimes.com/wardead/name/mark-j-daily/\">Lt. Mark J. Daily</a> of Irvine, who was inspired to join the war by the political writing of war advocate Christopher Hitchens. Hitchens has since gone to write a moving response to learning of Daily's readership, and sacrifice, that you can find <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2007/11/hitchens200711\">here</a>.</li>\n\n\t<li>Finally, I'd suggest checking out <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/video/?autoStart=true&amp;topVideoCatNo=default&amp;clipId=2521929\">the video of California's Riverside Cemetery</a> by the LAT's Saatchi Cunningham. Riverside is home to dozens of veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, the top resting place in the state.</li>\n\n</ul>",

   "author": 1, 
   "body_html": "<p>I signed up for Twitter this morning, opening an account at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/palewire\">http://twitter.com/palewire</a>. Since I haven't seen or heard from my cell phone in a week or two, don't count on much on the scene reporting. But I did take a few minutes this morning to line up <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/user/palewire\">my Last.fm feed</a>, so that my lastest listenings are now automatically Twittered to the huddled masses yearning to have my musical taste shoved down their throat.</p>\n<p>For any other Ubuntu users who'd like to follow along, here's a quick recap on how I made it happen.</p>\n<p>1. Move to the folder where you store random scripts. Me, I use...</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"nb\">cd</span> /usr/local/bin\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>2. Create a new Perl script and open it in gedit.</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>sudo gedit twitter_fm.pl\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>3. Copy and paste in the <a href=\"http://walterhiggins.net/lastfm_to_twitter.html\">ready-to-serve code</a> provided by Walter Higgins.</p>\n<p>4. Edit in your Twitter and Last.fm login information.

   "title": "Python Recipe: Connect to MySQL, query, print the results.", 
   "author": 1, 
   "body_html": "<p>Today let's take a look at how you can use Python to connect to your MySQL database, issue a SQL query and do things with the results.</p>\n<p>It's not that hard to write a simple SQL command by hand and muck with the results, so why bother? Like earlier recipes, our reward will be saving time and energy by automating a task that would normally require manual labor. It becomes clear when you bump into something you need to do 500 times, or make part of your daily routine.</p>\n<p>For example, one thing I try to do at work is keep documentation related to all of my datasets. I keep a series of wiki pages devoted to each database that lists its data sources, explains its origins, catalogs helpful SQL snippets and defines the fields in each table.</p>\n<p>The wiki application I use -- <a href=\"http://twiki.org/\">TWiki</a> -- accepts HTML code and the convention I've settled on is to format each table's field definitions in a standard set of <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_table.asp\">table tags</a>. So every time I add a new MySQL table and want to document it, I need to build another HTML table for the wiki. That's a pain to do by hand, especially when the table has a lot of fields. To save Ben the trouble, let's write a simple Python script that will...</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log into the MySQL database</li>\n<li>Acquire the list of columns from a MySQL table</li>\n<li>Print the columns out in an HTML table</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's not very exciting, but it'll introduce you to the basics. And once you start walking you'll quickly be able to run.</p>\n<h2>1. Install the MySQLdb module.</h2>\n<p>Before you can tap into your MySQL db with Python, you need to install the \"MySQL for Python\" module (a.k.a. MySQLdb). The file is found <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/\">here</a>, and, while I haven't tested it, it looks like there's a .exe installer for you Windows kids. There's also a nice stab and cataloging different methods <a href=\"http://docs.turbogears.org/1.0/DatabaseMySQL\">here</a>. If, like me, you're running Ubuntu Linux, installation is as simple as opening GNOME's package manager and selecting the \"python-mysqldb\" package, or running an \"apt-get\" from your terminal.</p>\n<p>You can test whether its been properly installed by opening up your python shell and trying to import the module. So fire up the shell...</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>python\n</pre></div>\n\n\n...and pop it off...\n\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"n\">Python</span> <span class=\"mf\">2.5</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"mf\">1</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">r251</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"mf\">54863</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">Mar</span>  <span class=\"mf\">7</span> <span class=\"mf\">2008</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mf\">04</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"mf\">10</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"mf\">12</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">GCC</span> <span class=\"mf\">4.1</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"mf\">3</span> <span class=\"mf\">20070929</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">prerelease</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Ubuntu</span> <span class=\"mf\">4.1</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"mf\">2</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mf\">16</span><span class=\"n\">ubuntu2</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span> <span class=\"n\">on</span> <span class=\"n\">linux2</span>\n<span class=\"n\">Type</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot;help&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot;copyright&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot;credits&quot;</span> <span class=\"ow\">or</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot;license&quot;</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">more</span> <span class=\"n\">information</span><span class=\"o\">.</span>\n<span class=\"o\">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">MySQLdb</span>\n<span class=\"o\">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> \n</pre></div>\n\n<p>If the interpreter accepts the commands and kicks down the next line without an error, you know you're okay. If it throws an error, you know something is off.</p>\n<h2>2. Open the command line, create a working directory, move there.</h2>\n<p>Before we get going, let me just say that I'm going to assume you read the first couple recipes and won't be working too hard to explain the stuff covered there. And keep in mind that my keystrokes are coming right off my home computer, which runs Ubuntu Linux. I'll try to provide Mac and Windows translations as we go, but I might muck a phoneme here and there. If anything is screwed up and doesn't work on your end, just shoot me an email or drop a comment. We'll iron it out.</p>\n<p>We're going to start the same way we did in the first lessons, creating a working folder for all our files and moving in with our command line.</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"n\">cd</span> <span class=\"n\">Documents</span><span class=\"o\">/</span>\n<span class=\"n\">mkdir</span> <span class=\"n\">py</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">connect</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">to</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">mysql</span>\n<span class=\"n\">cd</span> <span class=\"n\">py</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">connect</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">to</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"n\">mysql</span><span class=\"o\">/</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The commands should work just as easily in Mac as in Linux. If you're working in Windows, you'll be on the C:/ file structure, rather than the Unix-style structure above. So you might mkdir a new working directory in your C:/TEMP folder or wherever else you'd like to work. Or just make a folder wherever through Windows Explorer and cd there after the fact through the command line.</p>\n<h2>3. Create our python script in the text editor of your choice.</h2>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>vim py-connect-to-mysql.py\n</pre></div>\n\n\nThe line above, which again should work for Linux or Mac, will open a new file in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vim.org%2F&amp;ei=uzoESIj8LKnmpgTRy43VBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8C6iOb5uQLy74YKg-WBd9hikKaw&amp;sig2=vP2XqMTTDBFF49Gy22gxJQ\">vim</a>, the command-line text editor that I prefer. You can follow along, or feel free to make your own file in the application you prefer. If you're a newbie Windows user, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNotepad&amp;ei=zToESKWNL4uqpwT2k73dBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEXWgXDcow8vXjueJBIOmWghv1lhw&amp;sig2=aDintKlEbbRHHWcaHXoz1w\">Notepad</a> should work great.\n\n\n\n<p>If you're following along in vim, you'll need to enter \"insert mode\" so you can start entering text. Do that by hitting:</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>i\n</pre></div>\n\n<h2>4.

The <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/lib/module-sys.html\">\"sys\" module</a> will allow us to accept inputs from the command line later, and our new friend, MySQLdb, will help us connect to the database. </p>\n<p>Then you can see that the bulk of the script is taken up by a function, named PrintFields, that extends from line four to line 32. That contains all of the card tricks we'll need to connect to our local db, run a query and print it out however we want. In this case, we're spitting out the data in an HTML shell I've concocted to create a complete table when it's all done. </p>\n<p>After the loop closes at line 32, the remainder of the script uses sys to grab the first two arguments passed in by the user and hand them over to the function. So this way, by providing the database and table names at the time of execution, I can ask the script to print out the fields from any table I've got. For instance, we can print out the generic time_zone table that comes MySQL's \"mysql\" settings database like so...</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>python py-connect-to-mysql.py mysql time_zone\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>And you should get something like ...</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>Wikified HTML <span class=\"k\">for </span>mysql.time_zone\n<span class=\"o\">========================</span>\n&lt;table <span class=\"nv\">border</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;0&quot;</span>&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;order&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;name&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;type&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;description&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Time_zone_id&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;int<span class=\"o\">(</span>10<span class=\"o\">)</span> unsigned&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Use_leap_seconds&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;enum<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;Y&#39;</span>,<span class=\"s1\">&#39;N&#39;</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Then what I'd normally do is just copy and paste that into my wiki. The script doesn't have any error handling or fancy tricks, which I think makes it a good starter example on the basics. Let's pull out the things you'll need to know. So let's walk through a few of them.</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>    <span class=\"n\">host</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">&#39;localhost&#39;</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">user</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">&#39;user&#39;</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">password</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">&#39;password&#39;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>This first snippet contains all the local information about your MySQL that will need to be customized to fit your rig. You'll need to change the definitions for user and password to whatever it is you use. And if the database you want to tap isn't on your localhost, but perhaps networked elsewhere, you'll need to change the host definition to its IP address or alias.</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>    <span class=\"n\">conn</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">MySQLdb</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Connection</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">db</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">database</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">host</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">host</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">user</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">user</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">passwd</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">password</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">mysql</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">conn</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">cursor</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Then this next step will pass all of your local specifics to MySQLdb and open up a \"cursor.\" You can use that to interact with the database in the same way you normally would with Microsoft Access or another piece of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface\">GUI software</a>. A lot of people might name the variable containing the cursor as \"cursor,\" but it really doesn't matter. As seen above, I like to name it mysql. It's just personal preference. Notice that we didn't define the database variable in the earlier snippet. That's because it's being passed into the function by the user. We know that because it's up there at the top of our function...</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">PrintFields</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">database</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">table</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>...and fed in at the bottom after we capture the user input with sys...</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"n\">users_database</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">sys</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">argv</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mf\">1</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n...and then passed in with our function call...\n\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"n\">PrintFields</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">users_database</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">users_table</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>But what the hell is in that argv variable, anyway? Let's find out.

Hope this is helpful to somebody.</p>", 
   "body_markup": "<p>Today let's take a look at how you can use Python to connect to your MySQL database, issue a SQL query and do things with the results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's not that hard to write a simple SQL command by hand and muck with the results, so why bother? Like earlier recipes, our reward will be saving time and energy by automating a task that would normally require manual labor. It becomes clear when you bump into something you need to do 500 times, or make part of your daily routine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, one thing I try to do at work is keep documentation related to all of my datasets. I keep a series of wiki pages devoted to each database that lists its data sources, explains its origins, catalogs helpful SQL snippets and defines the fields in each table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wiki application I use -- <a href=\"http://twiki.org/\">TWiki</a> -- accepts HTML code and the convention I've settled on is to format each table's field definitions in a standard set of <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_table.asp\">table tags</a>. So every time I add a new MySQL table and want to document it, I need to build another HTML table for the wiki. That's a pain to do by hand, especially when the table has a lot of fields. To save Ben the trouble, let's write a simple Python script that will...</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\n\t<li>Log into the MySQL database</li>\n\n\t<li>Acquire the list of columns from a MySQL table</li>\n\n\t<li>Print the columns out in an HTML table</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It's not very exciting, but it'll introduce you to the basics. And once you start walking you'll quickly be able to run.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Install the MySQLdb module.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you can tap into your MySQL db with Python, you need to install the \"MySQL for Python\" module (a.k.a. MySQLdb). The file is found <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/\">here</a>, and, while I haven't tested it, it looks like there's a .exe installer for you Windows kids. There's also a nice stab and cataloging different methods <a href=\"http://docs.turbogears.org/1.0/DatabaseMySQL\">here</a>. If, like me, you're running Ubuntu Linux, installation is as simple as opening GNOME's package manager and selecting the \"python-mysqldb\" package, or running an \"apt-get\" from your terminal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test whether its been properly installed by opening up your python shell and trying to import the module. So fire up the shell...</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">python</pre>\n\n...and pop it off...\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\">Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Mar  7 2008, 04:10:12)\n\n[GCC 4.1.3 20070929 (prerelease) (Ubuntu 4.1.2-16ubuntu2)] on linux2\n\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n\n>>> import MySQLdb\n\n>>> </pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If the interpreter accepts the commands and kicks down the next line without an error, you know you're okay. If it throws an error, you know something is off.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Open the command line, create a working directory, move there.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get going, let me just say that I'm going to assume you read the first couple recipes and won't be working too hard to explain the stuff covered there. And keep in mind that my keystrokes are coming right off my home computer, which runs Ubuntu Linux. I'll try to provide Mac and Windows translations as we go, but I might muck a phoneme here and there. If anything is screwed up and doesn't work on your end, just shoot me an email or drop a comment. We'll iron it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We're going to start the same way we did in the first lessons, creating a working folder for all our files and moving in with our command line.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\">cd Documents/\n\nmkdir py-connect-to-mysql\n\ncd py-connect-to-mysql/</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The commands should work just as easily in Mac as in Linux. If you're working in Windows, you'll be on the C:/ file structure, rather than the Unix-style structure above. So you might mkdir a new working directory in your C:/TEMP folder or wherever else you'd like to work. Or just make a folder wherever through Windows Explorer and cd there after the fact through the command line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Create our python script in the text editor of your choice.</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">vim py-connect-to-mysql.py</pre>\n\nThe line above, which again should work for Linux or Mac, will open a new file in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vim.org%2F&amp;ei=uzoESIj8LKnmpgTRy43VBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8C6iOb5uQLy74YKg-WBd9hikKaw&amp;sig2=vP2XqMTTDBFF49Gy22gxJQ\">vim</a>, the command-line text editor that I prefer. You can follow along, or feel free to make your own file in the application you prefer. If you're a newbie Windows user, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNotepad&amp;ei=zToESKWNL4uqpwT2k73dBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEXWgXDcow8vXjueJBIOmWghv1lhw&amp;sig2=aDintKlEbbRHHWcaHXoz1w\">Notepad</a> should work great.\n\n\n\n<p>If you're following along in vim, you'll need to enter \"insert mode\" so you can start entering text. Do that by hitting:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">i</pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Write the code!</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\" line=\"1\">#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport sys, MySQLdb\n\n\n\ndef PrintFields(database, table):\n\n    \"\"\" Connects to the table specified by the user and prints out its fields in HTML format used by Ben's wiki. \"\"\"\n\n\n\n    host = 'localhost'\n\n    user = 'user'\n\n    password = 'password'\n\n    conn = MySQLdb.Connection(db=database, host=host, user=user, passwd=password)\n\n    mysql = conn.cursor()\n\n\n\n    sql = \"\"\" SHOW COLUMNS FROM %s \"\"\" % table\n\n    mysql.execute(sql)\n\n\n\n    fields=mysql.fetchall()\n\n\n\n    print '<table border=\"0\"><tr><th>order</th><th>name</th><th>type</th><th>description</th></tr>'\n\n    print '<tbody>'\n\n\n\n    counter = 0\n\n    for field in fields:\n\n        counter = counter + 1\n\n        name = field[0]\n\n        type = field[1]\n\n        print '<tr><td>' + str(counter) + '</td><td>' + name + '</td><td>' + type + '</td><td></td></tr>'\n\n\n\n    print '</tbody>'\n\n    print '</table>'\n\n\n\n    mysql.close()\n\n    conn.close()\n\n\n\nusers_database = sys.argv[1]\n\nusers_table = sys.argv[2]\n\nprint \"Wikified HTML for \" + users_database + \".\" + users_table\n\nprint \"========================\"\n\nPrintFields(users_database, users_table)</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, the first thing you need to do is import the modules we need. The <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/lib/module-sys.html\">\"sys\" module</a> will allow us to accept inputs from the command line later, and our new friend, MySQLdb, will help us connect to the database. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you can see that the bulk of the script is taken up by a function, named PrintFields, that extends from line four to line 32. That contains all of the card tricks we'll need to connect to our local db, run a query and print it out however we want. In this case, we're spitting out the data in an HTML shell I've concocted to create a complete table when it's all done. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the loop closes at line 32, the remainder of the script uses sys to grab the first two arguments passed in by the user and hand them over to the function. So this way, by providing the database and table names at the time of execution, I can ask the script to print out the fields from any table I've got. For instance, we can print out the generic time_zone table that comes MySQL's \"mysql\" settings database like so...</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">python py-connect-to-mysql.py mysql time_zone</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And you should get something like ...</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">Wikified HTML for mysql.time_zone\n\n========================\n\n<table border=\"0\"><tr><th>order</th><th>name</th><th>type</th><th>description</th></tr>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr><td>1</td><td>Time_zone_id</td><td>int(10) unsigned</td><td></td></tr>\n\n<tr><td>2</td><td>Use_leap_seconds</td><td>enum('Y','N')</td><td></td></tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Then what I'd normally do is just copy and paste that into my wiki. The script doesn't have any error handling or fancy tricks, which I think makes it a good starter example on the basics. Let's pull out the things you'll need to know. So let's walk through a few of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\" line=\"7\">\n\n    host = 'localhost'\n\n    user = 'user'\n\n    password = 'password'\n\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This first snippet contains all the local information about your MySQL that will need to be customized to fit your rig. You'll need to change the definitions for user and password to whatever it is you use. And if the database you want to tap isn't on your localhost, but perhaps networked elsewhere, you'll need to change the host definition to its IP address or alias.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\" line=\"10\">\n\n    conn = MySQLdb.Connection(db=database, host=host, user=user, passwd=password)\n\n    mysql = conn.cursor()\n\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Then this next step will pass all of your local specifics to MySQLdb and open up a \"cursor.\" You can use that to interact with the database in the same way you normally would with Microsoft Access or another piece of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface\">GUI software</a>. A lot of people might name the variable containing the cursor as \"cursor,\" but it really doesn't matter. As seen above, I like to name it mysql. It's just personal preference. Notice that we didn't define the database variable in the earlier snippet. That's because it's being passed into the function by the user. We know that because it's up there at the top of our function...</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\" line=\"4\">def PrintFields(database, table):</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>...and fed in at the bottom after we capture the user input with sys...</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\" line=\"34\">users_database = sys.argv[1]</pre>\n\n...and then passed in with our function call...\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\" line=\"38\">PrintFields(users_database, users_table)</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>But what the hell is in that argv variable, anyway? Let's find out. I'm going to edit our script to include the following line...</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\">print sys.argv</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>...run the script again...</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">python py-connect-to-mysql.py mysql time_zone</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>...and here's what we get...</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">\n\n['py-connect-to-mysql.py', 'mysql', 'time_zone']</pre>\n\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty self-explanatory, right? Now back to our function.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\" line=\"13\">\n\n    sql = \" SHOW COLUMNS FROM %s \" % table\n\n    mysql.execute(sql)\n\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>With our connection set, the next thing to do is to use MySQL to run a query.

By doing that, we're now able to run that same SHOW COLUMNS command on whatever database and table combination we pass in. Provided the table actually exists. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's simple tricks like that which will enable you to really start flying with automation. What if your job required you to kick out data reports for each or any of the 50 states on command, or if you wanted to automate a web scrape to deposit its findings in your database every time it runs, or maybe even make an RSS feed that updates every 15 minutes. A simple concept like this, which allows for some of the SQL specifics to be specified programmatically, could save you a ton of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\" line=\"16\">   fields=mysql.fetchall()</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This next line will store the results of the query in a variable called fields, which we'll print out using one of the simple loops I covered in <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/05/python-recipe-open-a-file-read-through-it-print-each-line-matching-a-search-term/\">previous recipes</a>, pulling out the first and second fields (name and datatype) for my table.

   "author": 1, 
   "body_html": "<p>Here's a change of pace. Our <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/05/python-recipe-open-a-file-read-through-it-print-each-line-matching-a-search-term/\">first</a> <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/07/python-recipe-open-multiple-files-search-for-matches-count-your-hits-on-the-fly/\">few</a> <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/14/python-recipe-read-a-file-search-for-a-pattern-print-your-matches/\">lessons</a> focused on how you can use Python to goof with a bunch of local files. This time we're going to try something different: using Python to go online and screw around with the Web. </p>\n<p>Whenever I caucus with aspiring <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nicar.org%2F&amp;ei=1HYLSJWzII6IiwGuhvj7Ag&amp;usg=AFQjCNFv1OMXDU_2U5mOn6I-DfJcHnfT7Q&amp;sig2=PRhstdzVRiSElCZCCA9pQA\">NICARians</a> and other data hungry reporters, it's not long before the topic of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping\">web scraping</a> comes up. While automated text processing and database management may sound well and good, there's something sexy about pulling down a fatty government database that catches people's imagination and inspires them to take on the challenge of learning a new programming language. Or at least entertain the idea until they run into a road block.</p>\n<p>A number of fellow travelers do a noble job instructing people on the basics during NICAR's annual seminars. But scraping seems like such a sought-after skill that it feels like a good idea to throw up a basic walkthrough here, where beginners can cut and paste code and any feedback can be memorialized. </p>\n<p>But before we get going, let me just say that I'm going to assume you read the first couple recipes and won't be working too hard to explain the stuff covered there. And keep in mind that my keystrokes are coming right off my home computer, which runs Ubuntu Linux. I'll try to provide Mac and Windows translations as we go, but I might muck a phoneme here and there. If anything is screwed up and doesn't work on your end, just shoot me an email or drop a comment. We'll iron it out.</p>\n<p>Formalities aside, here's the example task I've selected to achieve our mission.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the necessary Python modules, mechanize and Beautiful Soup.</li>\n<li>Train our computer to visit Ben's list of <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/2007.html\">The Greatest Albums in the History of 2007</a>.</li>\n<li>Parse the html and scrape out Ben's rankings.</li>\n<li>Click through to Ben's list of <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/2006.html\">The Greatest Albums in the History of 2006</a> and repeat the scrape.</li>\n<li>Do it all over again, but this time download the cover art.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>1. Download the mechanize and Beautiful Soup modules. Install them. </h2>\n<p>There are a dozen different methods for going about our task, so you shouldn't assume the one I'm about to show you is the only or the best. It's just one way to do it. And doing it this way requires a couple additions to your Python installation, which might seem a little daunting but should be doable unless IT has your computer on double secret probation. </p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.python.org/doc/2.0.1/tut/node8.html\">module</a> is a collection of functions, defintions and statements contained in a separate file that you can import into your script. Examples native to Python used in our earlier scripts included \"re\", \"os\" and \"string.\" </p>\n<p>Out there on the Web, kind and ambitious programmers are constantly drafting, updating and publishing new modules to boil down complicated tasks into simpler forms. It it wasn't for these people, praise be upon them, I probably wouldn't have a job. </p>\n<p>If you want to take advantage of their contributions, you need to plug their creations into your local Python installation. It's usually not that hard, even on Windows!</p>\n<p>To accomplish today's task, we're going to rely on two third-party modules. The first is <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwwwsearch.sourceforge.net%2Fmechanize%2F&amp;ei=WokLSJr3A52qiAHS6L38Ag&amp;usg=AFQjCNGUEUs6Jn1FSoo0YYjpZ2PJe6E6Ag&amp;sig2=I3rdoLQ5AV843Eignvjxgg\">mechanize</a>, a Python translation of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.cpan.org%2Fdist%2FWWW-Mechanize%2F&amp;ei=gIkLSOmaMY-ShAOc38TDAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEsooTEHj6bN2UHDi0OfZ2krEX-EA&amp;sig2=zPl5yUdSVr0loDl4qaaUYQ\">the popular Perl module</a> for calling up and walking through Web pages. The second is <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crummy.com%2Fsoftware%2FBeautifulSoup%2F&amp;ei=tIkLSITRIYjGigHqmez7Ag&amp;usg=AFQjCNHAxwplurFOBqg5cehWQEVKi-TuLQ&amp;sig2=UhVMcFqeJrnKIp2wIF5t6g\">Beautiful Soup</a>, a superlatively elegant means for parsing HTML and XML documents. Working hand-in-hand, they can accomplish most simple web scrapes.</p>\n<p>If you're working Linux or Mac OS X, this is going to be a piece of cake. All you need is to use Python's auto-installer <a href=\"http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall\">Easy Install</a> to issue the following commands:</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>sudo easy_install mechanize\nsudo easy_install BeautifulSoup\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>And now you can check if the modules are available for use by cracking open your python interpreter...</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>python\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>...and attempting to import the new modules...</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">mechanize</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Browser</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">BeautifulSoup</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">BeautifulSoup</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>If the interpreter accepts the commands and kicks down the next line without an error, you know you're okay. If it throws an error, you know something is off. </p>\n<p>I don't have a lot of Python experience working in Windows, but the method for adding modules that I've had success with is simply downloading the .py files to my desktop and dumping them in the \"lib\" folder of my Python installation. If, like me, you use Activestate's <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/Products/activepython/?_x=1\">ActivePython</a> distribution for Windows, it should be easily found at C:/Python25/lib/. And when you browse around the directory, you should already see os.py, re.py and other modules we're already familar with. So just visit the <a href=\"http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/\">mechanize</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/\">Beautiful Soup</a> homepages and retrieve the latest download. Dump the .py files in your lib folder and now you should be able to fire up your python interpreter just the same as above and introduce yourself to our new friends.</p>\n<p>With that out of the way, we now have all the tools we need to grip and rip. So let's do it!</p>\n<h2>2. Open the command line, create a working directory, move there.</h2>\n<p>We're going to start the same way we did in the first three lessons, creating a working folder for all our files and moving in with our command line.</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"nb\">cd </span>Documents/\nmkdir py-scrape-and-download\n<span class=\"nb\">cd </span>py-scrape-and-download/\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The commands should work just as easily in Mac as in Linux. If you're working in Windows, you'll be on the C:/ file structure, rather than the Unix-style structure above. So you might mkdir a new working directory in your C:/TEMP folder or wherever else you'd like to work. Or just make a folder wherever through Windows Explorer and cd there after the fact through the command line.</p>\n<h2>3. Create our python script in the text editor of your choice.</h2>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>vim py-scrape-and-download.py\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The line above, which again should work for Linux or Mac, will open a new file in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vim.org%2F&amp;ei=uzoESIj8LKnmpgTRy43VBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8C6iOb5uQLy74YKg-WBd9hikKaw&amp;sig2=vP2XqMTTDBFF49Gy22gxJQ\">vim</a>, the command-line text editor that I prefer. You can follow along, or feel free to make your own file in the application you prefer.

Do that by hitting:</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>i\n</pre></div>\n\n<h2>4.

We then use its open() method to grab the location of our first scrape target, <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/14/python-recipe-read-a-file-search-for-a-pattern-print-your-matches/\">my favorite albums of 2007</a>, and store that in another variable we'll call page. </p>\n<p>That's enough to go out on the web and grab the page, now we need to tell Python what to do with it. Mechanize's read() method will return all of the HTML in the page, which we store, simply, in an variable called html and then pass to BeautifulSoup's default method so it can be prepared for processing.</p>\n<p>The reason we need to pass the page to Beautiful Soup is that there is a ton of HTML code in the page we don't want. Our ultimate goal isn't to print out the complete page source. We don't want all the junky td and img and body tags. We want to free the data from the HTML by printing it out in a machine readable format we can repurpose for our own needs. In the next step we'll ask Beautiful Soup to step through the code and pull out only the good parts, but here in the first iteration we'll pause with just printing out the complete page code using a fun Beautiful Soup method called prettify(). It will spit out the HTML in a well-formed format. To take a look, save and quit out of your script (ESC, SHIFT+ZZ in vim) and fire it up from the command-line:</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>python py-scrape-and-download.py\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>And you should see something like....</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"nt\">&lt;html&gt;</span>\n <span class=\"nt\">&lt;head&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;title&gt;</span>\n   According to Ben...\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/title&gt;</span>\n <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/head&gt;</span>\n <span class=\"nt\">&lt;body&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;h2&gt;</span>\n   The 10 Greatest Albums in the History of 2007\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/h2&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;table</span> <span class=\"na\">padding=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;1&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">width=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;60%&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">border=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;1&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">style=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;text-align:center;&quot;</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n   <span class=\"nt\">&lt;tr</span> <span class=\"na\">style=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;td&gt;</span>\n     Rank\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/td&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;td&gt;</span>\n     Artist\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/td&gt;</span>\n...\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>...which means that you've successfully retrieved and printed out our first target.

I like to do this using the Firefox plugin <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843\">Firebug</a>, which allows you to right-click and, by choosing the \"Inspect Element\" option, have the browser pull up and highlight the HTML underlying any portion of the page. But all that's really necessary is that you take a look at the page's source code. </p>\n<p>Since most HTML pages you'll be targeting, including my sample site, will include more than one set of table tags, you often have to find something unique about the table you're after. This is necessary so that Beautiful Soup knows how to zoom in on that section of the code you're after and ignore all the flotsam around it. </p>\n<p>If you look closely at this particular page, you'll note that while both table tags have the same width value, an easy way to distinguish them is that they have different border values...</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"nt\">&lt;table</span> <span class=\"na\">width=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;60%&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">border=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;1&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">style=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;text-align: center;&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">padding=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;1&quot;</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n...\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;table</span> <span class=\"na\">width=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;60%&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">border=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;0&quot;</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>...and the one we want to harvest has a border value of one. That's why the first Beautiful Soup command seen in the snippet above uses the find() method to capture the table with that characteristic.</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"n\">table</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">soup</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">find</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;table&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">border</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mf\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Once that's been accomplished, the new table variable is immediately put to use in a loop that is designed to step through each row and pull out the data we want.</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">row</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">table</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">findAll</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&#39;tr&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)[</span><span class=\"mf\">1</span><span class=\"p\">:]:</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>It uses Beautiful Soup's findAll() method to put all of the tr tags (which is the HTML equivalent of a row) into a list. The [1:] modifier at the end instructs the loop to skip the first item, which, from looking at the page, we can tell is an unneeded header line. </p>\n<p>Then, after the loop is set up on the tr tags, we set up another list that will grab all of the td tags (the HTML equivalent of a column) from each row. </p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>    <span class=\"n\">col</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">row</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">findAll</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&#39;td&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Now pulling out the data is simply a matter of figuring out which order we can expect the data to appear in each row and pulling the corresponding values from the list. Since we expect rank, artist, album and cover to appear in each row from left to right, the first element of the col variable (col[0]) can always be expected to be the rank and the last element (col[3]) can always be expected to be the cover. So we create a new set of values to retrieve each, with some Beautiful Soup specific objects tacked on the end to grab only the bits we want.</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>    <span class=\"n\">rank</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">col</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mf\">0</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">string</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">artist</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">col</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mf\">1</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">string</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">album</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">col</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mf\">2</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">string</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">cover_link</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">col</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mf\">3</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">img</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s\">&#39;src&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The \".string\" object will return the text within the target tag (similar to javascript's innerHTML method). But in the case of something like the cover art, which is an image tag, not a string value, we can step down to the next tag nested within the td column -- img -- and access its source attribute by tacking on ['src']. This would work just the same for a hyperlink (.a['href']) or any other attibute. And if you've got multiple layers of nested tags, you can simply step down through them with a linked set of objects. For example, \"b.a.string\" would retrieve the string within a link within a bold tag. There's great documentation on these and other Beautiful Soup tricks <a href=\"http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/documentation.html\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>After we've wrangled out the data we want from the HTML, the only challenge remaining is to print it out. I accomplish that above by loading the column values into a list called record and printing it out use a trick that will print them with a pipe-delimiter using the .join method.</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>    <span class=\"n\">record</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">rank</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">artist</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">album</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">cover_link</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">print</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot;|&quot;</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">join</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">record</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Phew. That's a lot of explaining. I hope it made sense. I'm happy to clarify or elaborate on any of it. But if you save the snippet above and run it. You should get a simple print out of the data that looks something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>10|LCD Soundsystem|Sound of Silver|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/sound%20of%20silver.jpg\n9|Ulrich Schnauss|Goodbye|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/goodbye.jpg\n8|The Clientele|God Save The Clientele|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/god%20save%20the%20clientele.jpg\n7|The Modernist|Collectors Series Pt. 1: Popular Songs|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/collectors%20series.jpg\n6|Bebel Gilberto|Momento|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/memento.jpg\n5|Various Artists|Jay Deelicious: 1995-1998|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/jaydeelicious.jpg\n4|Lindstrom and Prins Thomas|BBC Essential Mix|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/lindstrom%20prins%20thomas.jpg\n3|Go Home Productions|This Was Pop|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/this%20was%20pop.jpg\n2|Apparat|Walls|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/walls.jpg\n1|Caribou|Andorra|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/andorra.jpg\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>See the difference?! Pretty cool, right?</p>\n<p>But, really, you could of done that with copy and paste. Or, if you're slick, maybe even <a href=\"http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10877_11-6115870.html?part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=tr\">Excel's Web Query</a>.</p>\n<p>As with our previous recipes, the real efficiencies aren't found until you can train your computer to repeat a task over a large body of data. One of the great things mechanize can do is step through pages one by one and help Beautiful Soup suck the data out of each. This is very helpful when you're trying to scrape the search results from online web queries, which are commonly displayed in paginated sets that run into hundreds and hundreds of pages.</p>\n<p>Today's example is only two pages in length, though the principles we learn here can later be applied to broader data sets. But before we can run, we have to learn how to walk. So, in that spirit, here's a simple expansion of our script above that will click on the \"Next\" link at the bottom of our example page and repeat the scrape on <a

The only change is that the soup variable is now being passed to the extract function along with the year, so that it can be printed alongside the data columns in our output by adding it to the \"record\" list inside the function here:</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>        <span class=\"n\">record</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">year</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"n\">rank</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">artist</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">album</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">cover_link</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>I figured it's a nice add since then our eventual results will contain a field that discerns the 2007 list from the 2006 list. </p>\n<p>Now check out easy it is to get mechanize to step through to the next page.</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"n\">page2</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">mech</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">follow_link</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">text_regex</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;Next&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">html2</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">page2</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">read</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"n\">soup2</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">BeautifulSoup</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">html2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">extract</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">soup2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mf\">2006</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>All it takes is feeding the link's string value to mechanize's follow_link() method and, boom, you're walking over to the next page.

All you have to do is add it to your import line, as below, and tell it where to save the files. I just stuff it in the extract loop so it pulls down the file immediately after scraping its row in the table.

If this is useful for people, next time we can cover how you leverage these basic tools against search forms and larger result sets.

Hope this is helpful to somebody.</p>\n<p>And, as a postscript, since we're kind of on a roll here, I thought it might be fun to cook up an LAT version of the <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pythoncook/\">Python Cookbook</a> cover, in the classic O'Reilly style. What do you think? I couldn't quite find the right font.</p>\n<img src=\"http://www.palewire.com/images/oreilly_lat.gif\" alt=\"The Reporter's Python Cookbook\" border=\"1\" />", 
   "body_markup": "<p>Here's a change of pace. Our <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/05/python-recipe-open-a-file-read-through-it-print-each-line-matching-a-search-term/\">first</a> <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/07/python-recipe-open-multiple-files-search-for-matches-count-your-hits-on-the-fly/\">few</a> <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/14/python-recipe-read-a-file-search-for-a-pattern-print-your-matches/\">lessons</a> focused on how you can use Python to goof with a bunch of local files. This time we're going to try something different: using Python to go online and screw around with the Web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever I caucus with aspiring <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nicar.org%2F&ei=1HYLSJWzII6IiwGuhvj7Ag&usg=AFQjCNFv1OMXDU_2U5mOn6I-DfJcHnfT7Q&sig2=PRhstdzVRiSElCZCCA9pQA\">NICARians</a> and other data hungry reporters, it's not long before the topic of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping\">web scraping</a> comes up. While automated text processing and database management may sound well and good, there's something sexy about pulling down a fatty government database that catches people's imagination and inspires them to take on the challenge of learning a new programming language. Or at least entertain the idea until they run into a road block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of fellow travelers do a noble job instructing people on the basics during NICAR's annual seminars. But scraping seems like such a sought-after skill that it feels like a good idea to throw up a basic walkthrough here, where beginners can cut and paste code and any feedback can be memorialized. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we get going, let me just say that I'm going to assume you read the first couple recipes and won't be working too hard to explain the stuff covered there. And keep in mind that my keystrokes are coming right off my home computer, which runs Ubuntu Linux. I'll try to provide Mac and Windows translations as we go, but I might muck a phoneme here and there. If anything is screwed up and doesn't work on your end, just shoot me an email or drop a comment. We'll iron it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Formalities aside, here's the example task I've selected to achieve our mission.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\n\t<li>Install the necessary Python modules, mechanize and Beautiful Soup.</li>\n\n\t<li>Train our computer to visit Ben's list of <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/2007.html\">The Greatest Albums in the History of 2007</a>.</li>\n\n\t<li>Parse the html and scrape out Ben's rankings.</li>\n\n\t<li>Click through to Ben's list of <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/2006.html\">The Greatest Albums in the History of 2006</a> and repeat the scrape.</li>\n\n        <li>Do it all over again, but this time download the cover art.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Download the mechanize and Beautiful Soup modules. Install them. </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a dozen different methods for going about our task, so you shouldn't assume the one I'm about to show you is the only or the best. It's just one way to do it. And doing it this way requires a couple additions to your Python installation, which might seem a little daunting but should be doable unless IT has your computer on double secret probation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.python.org/doc/2.0.1/tut/node8.html\">module</a> is a collection of functions, defintions and statements contained in a separate file that you can import into your script. Examples native to Python used in our earlier scripts included \"re\", \"os\" and \"string.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out there on the Web, kind and ambitious programmers are constantly drafting, updating and publishing new modules to boil down complicated tasks into simpler forms. It it wasn't for these people, praise be upon them, I probably wouldn't have a job. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to take advantage of their contributions, you need to plug their creations into your local Python installation. It's usually not that hard, even on Windows!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To accomplish today's task, we're going to rely on two third-party modules. The first is <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwwwsearch.sourceforge.net%2Fmechanize%2F&ei=WokLSJr3A52qiAHS6L38Ag&usg=AFQjCNGUEUs6Jn1FSoo0YYjpZ2PJe6E6Ag&sig2=I3rdoLQ5AV843Eignvjxgg\">mechanize</a>, a Python translation of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.cpan.org%2Fdist%2FWWW-Mechanize%2F&ei=gIkLSOmaMY-ShAOc38TDAw&usg=AFQjCNEsooTEHj6bN2UHDi0OfZ2krEX-EA&sig2=zPl5yUdSVr0loDl4qaaUYQ\">the popular Perl module</a> for calling up and walking through Web pages. The second is <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crummy.com%2Fsoftware%2FBeautifulSoup%2F&ei=tIkLSITRIYjGigHqmez7Ag&usg=AFQjCNHAxwplurFOBqg5cehWQEVKi-TuLQ&sig2=UhVMcFqeJrnKIp2wIF5t6g\">Beautiful Soup</a>, a superlatively elegant means for parsing HTML and XML documents. Working hand-in-hand, they can accomplish most simple web scrapes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're working Linux or Mac OS X, this is going to be a piece of cake. All you need is to use Python's auto-installer <a href=\"http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall\">Easy Install</a> to issue the following commands:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">sudo easy_install mechanize\n\nsudo easy_install BeautifulSoup</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And now you can check if the modules are available for use by cracking open your python interpreter...</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">python</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>...and attempting to import the new modules...</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\">\n\nfrom mechanize import Browser\n\nfrom BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup\n\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If the interpreter accepts the commands and kicks down the next line without an error, you know you're okay. If it throws an error, you know something is off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don't have a lot of Python experience working in Windows, but the method for adding modules that I've had success with is simply downloading the .py files to my desktop and dumping them in the \"lib\" folder of my Python installation. If, like me, you use Activestate's <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/Products/activepython/?_x=1\">ActivePython</a> distribution for Windows, it should be easily found at C:/Python25/lib/. And when you browse around the directory, you should already see os.py, re.py and other modules we're already familar with. So just visit the <a href=\"http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/\">mechanize</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/\">Beautiful Soup</a> homepages and retrieve the latest download. Dump the .py files in your lib folder and now you should be able to fire up your python interpreter just the same as above and introduce yourself to our new friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that out of the way, we now have all the tools we need to grip and rip. So let's do it!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Open the command line, create a working directory, move there.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We're going to start the same way we did in the first three lessons, creating a working folder for all our files and moving in with our command line.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">cd Documents/\n\nmkdir py-scrape-and-download\n\ncd py-scrape-and-download/</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The commands should work just as easily in Mac as in Linux. If you're working in Windows, you'll be on the C:/ file structure, rather than the Unix-style structure above. So you might mkdir a new working directory in your C:/TEMP folder or wherever else you'd like to work. Or just make a folder wherever through Windows Explorer and cd there after the fact through the command line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Create our python script in the text editor of your choice.</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">vim py-scrape-and-download.py</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The line above, which again should work for Linux or Mac, will open a new file in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vim.org%2F&ei=uzoESIj8LKnmpgTRy43VBw&usg=AFQjCNE8C6iOb5uQLy74YKg-WBd9hikKaw&sig2=vP2XqMTTDBFF49Gy22gxJQ\">vim</a>, the command-line text editor that I prefer. You can follow along, or feel free to make your own file in the application you prefer. If you're a newbie Windows user, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNotepad&ei=zToESKWNL4uqpwT2k73dBw&usg=AFQjCNEXWgXDcow8vXjueJBIOmWghv1lhw&sig2=aDintKlEbbRHHWcaHXoz1w\">Notepad</a> should work great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're following along in vim, you'll need to enter \"insert mode\" so you can start entering text. Do that by hitting:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">i</pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Write the code!</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\">#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nfrom mechanize import Browser\n\nfrom BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup\n\n\n\nmech = Browser()\n\n\n\nurl = \"http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/2007.html\"\n\npage = mech.open(url)\n\n\n\nhtml = page.read()\n\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html)\n\n\n\nprint soup.prettify()</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Our first snippet of code, seen above, shows a basic introduction to each of our new modules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After they've been imported in lines two and three, we put mechanize's browser to use right away, storing it a variable I've decided to call mech, but which you could call anything you wanted (ex. browser, br, ie, whatever). We then use its open() method to grab the location of our first scrape target, <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/14/python-recipe-read-a-file-search-for-a-pattern-print-your-matches/\">my favorite albums of 2007</a>, and store that in another variable we'll call page. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's enough to go out on the web and grab the page, now we need to tell Python what to do with it. Mechanize's read() method will return all of the HTML in the page, which we store, simply, in an variable called html and then pass to BeautifulSoup's default method so it can be prepared for processing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason we need to pass the page to Beautiful Soup is that there is a ton of HTML code in the page we don't want. Our ultimate goal isn't to print out the complete page source. We don't want all the junky td and img and body tags. We want to free the data from the HTML by printing it out in a machine readable format we can repurpose for our own needs. In the next step we'll ask Beautiful Soup to step through the code and pull out only the good parts, but here in the first iteration we'll pause with just printing out the complete page code using a fun Beautiful Soup method called prettify(). It will spit out the HTML in a well-formed format. To take a look, save and quit out of your script (ESC, SHIFT+ZZ in vim) and fire it up from the command-line:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">\n\npython py-scrape-and-download.py\n\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And you should see something like....</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"HTML\">\n\n<html>\n\n <head>\n\n  <title>\n\n   According to Ben...\n\n  </title>\n\n </head>\n\n <body>\n\n  <h2>\n\n   The 10 Greatest Albums in the History of 2007\n\n  </h2>\n\n  <table padding=\"1\" width=\"60%\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\n   <tr style=\"font-weight:bold\">\n\n    <td>\n\n     Rank\n\n    </td>\n\n    <td>\n\n     Artist\n\n    </td>\n\n...\n\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>...which means that you've successfully retrieved and printed out our first target. Now let's move on to scraping the data out from the HTML.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\">#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nfrom mechanize import Browser\n\nfrom BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup\n\n\n\nmech = Browser()\n\n\n\nurl = \"http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/2007.html\"\n\npage = mech.open(url)\n\n\n\nhtml = page.read()\n\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html)\n\n\n\ntable = soup.find(\"table\", border=1)\n\n\n\nfor row in table.findAll('tr')[1:]:\n\n    col = row.findAll('td')\n\n    \n\n    rank = col[0].string\n\n    artist = col[1].string\n\n    album = col[2].string\n\n    cover_link = col[3].img['src']\n\n\n\n    record = (rank, artist, album, cover_link)\n\n    print \"|\".join(record)\n\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The second version of our script, seen above, removes the prettify() command that concluded version one and replaces it with the Beautiful Soup code necessary to parse the rankings from the page. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you're scraping a real target out there on the wild Web, the mechanize part of the script is likely to remain pretty much the same, but the Beautiful Soup portion that pulls the data from the page is going to have change each time, tailored to work with however your target HTML is structured. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So your job as the scraper is to inspect your target table and figure out how you can get Beautiful Soup to hone in on the elements you want to harvest. I like to do this using the Firefox plugin <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843\">Firebug</a>, which allows you to right-click and, by choosing the \"Inspect Element\" option, have the browser pull up and highlight the HTML underlying any portion of the page. But all that's really necessary is that you take a look at the page's source code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since most HTML pages you'll be targeting, including my sample site, will include more than one set of table tags, you often have to find something unique about the table you're after. This is necessary so that Beautiful Soup knows how to zoom in on that section of the code you're after and ignore all the flotsam around it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look closely at this particular page, you'll note that while both table tags have the same width value, an easy way to distinguish them is that they have different border values...</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"HTML\">\n\n<table width=\"60%\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align: center;\" padding=\"1\">\n\n...\n\n<table width=\"60%\" border=\"0\">\n\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>...and the one we want to harvest has a border value of one. That's why the first Beautiful Soup command seen in the snippet above uses the find() method to capture the table with that characteristic.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\">\n\ntable = soup.find(\"table\", border=1)\n\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Once that's been accomplished, the new table variable is immediately put to use in a loop that is designed to step through each row and pull out the data we want.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\">\n\nfor row in table.findAll('tr')[1:]:\n\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>It uses Beautiful Soup's findAll() method to put all of the tr tags (which is the HTML equivalent of a row) into a list. The [1:] modifier at the end instructs the loop to skip the first item, which, from looking at the page, we can tell is an unneeded header line. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, after the loop is set up on the tr tags, we set up another list that will grab all of the td tags (the HTML equivalent of a column) from each row. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\">    col = row.findAll('td')</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now pulling out the data is simply a matter of figuring out which order we can expect the data to appear in each row and pulling the corresponding values from the list. Since we expect rank, artist, album and cover to appear in each row from left to right, the first element of the col variable (col[0]) can always be expected to be the rank and the last element (col[3]) can always be expected to be the cover. So we create a new set of values to retrieve each, with some Beautiful Soup specific objects tacked on the end to grab only the bits we want.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\">    rank = col[0].string\n\n    artist = col[1].string\n\n    album = col[2].string\n\n    cover_link = col[3].img['src']</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The \".string\" object will return the text within the target tag (similar to javascript's innerHTML method). But in the case of something like the cover art, which is an image tag, not a string value, we can step down to the next tag nested within the td column -- img -- and access its source attribute by tacking on ['src']. This would work just the same for a hyperlink (.a['href']) or any other attibute. And if you've got multiple layers of nested tags, you can simply step down through them with a linked set of objects. For example, \"b.a.string\" would retrieve the string within a link within a bold tag. There's great documentation on these and other Beautiful Soup tricks <a href=\"http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/documentation.html\">here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After we've wrangled out the data we want from the HTML, the only challenge remaining is to print it out. I accomplish that above by loading the column values into a list called record and printing it out use a trick that will print them with a pipe-delimiter using the .join method.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\">\n\n    record = (rank, artist, album, cover_link)\n\n    print \"|\".join(record)\n\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew. That's a lot of explaining. I hope it made sense. I'm happy to clarify or elaborate on any of it. But if you save the snippet above and run it. You should get a simple print out of the data that looks something like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"bash\">10|LCD Soundsystem|Sound of Silver|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/sound%20of%20silver.jpg\n\n9|Ulrich Schnauss|Goodbye|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/goodbye.jpg\n\n8|The Clientele|God Save The Clientele|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/god%20save%20the%20clientele.jpg\n\n7|The Modernist|Collectors Series Pt. 1: Popular Songs|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/collectors%20series.jpg\n\n6|Bebel Gilberto|Momento|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/memento.jpg\n\n5|Various Artists|Jay Deelicious: 1995-1998|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/jaydeelicious.jpg\n\n4|Lindstrom and Prins Thomas|BBC Essential Mix|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/lindstrom%20prins%20thomas.jpg\n\n3|Go Home Productions|This Was Pop|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/this%20was%20pop.jpg\n\n2|Apparat|Walls|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/walls.jpg\n\n1|Caribou|Andorra|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/andorra.jpg</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>See the difference?! Pretty cool, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, really, you could of done that with copy and paste. Or, if you're slick, maybe even <a href=\"http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10877_11-6115870.html?part=rss&tag=feed&subj=tr\">Excel's Web Query</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with our previous recipes, the real efficiencies aren't found until you can train your computer to repeat a task over a large body of data. One of the great things mechanize can do is step through pages one by one and help Beautiful Soup suck the data out of each. This is very helpful when you're trying to scrape the search results from online web queries, which are commonly displayed in paginated sets that run into hundreds and hundreds of pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today's example is only two pages in length, though the principles we learn here can later be applied to broader data sets. But before we can run, we have to learn how to walk. So, in that spirit, here's a simple expansion of our script above that will click on the \"Next\" link at the bottom of our example page and repeat the scrape on <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/2006.html\">my 2006 list</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\">#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nfrom mechanize import Browser\n\nfrom BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup\n\n\n\ndef extract(soup, year):\n\n\n\n    table = soup.find(\"table\", border=1)\n\n\n\n    for row in table.findAll('tr')[1:]:\n\n        col = row.findAll('td')\n\n    \n\n        rank = col[0].string\n\n        artist = col[1].string\n\n        album = col[2].string\n\n        cover_link = col[3].img['src']\n\n\n\n        record = (str(year), rank, artist, album, cover_link)\n\n        print \"|\".join(record)\n\n\n\n\n\nmech = Browser()\n\n\n\nurl = \"http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/2007.html\"\n\n\n\npage1 = mech.open(url)\n\nhtml1 = page1.read()\n\nsoup1 = BeautifulSoup(html1)\n\nextract(soup1, 2007)\n\n\n\npage2 = mech.follow_link(text_regex=\"Next\")\n\nhtml2 = page2.read()\n\nsoup2 = BeautifulSoup(html2)\n\nextract(soup2, 2006)</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that our Beautiful Soup snippet remains the same as above, but we've moved it to the top of the script and placed it in a <a href=\"http://www.penzilla.net/tutorials/python/functions/\">Python function</a> called extract. Structured this way, the extract function is reusable on any number of pages as long as the HTML you're looking to parse is formatted the same way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The function accepts two parameters, soup and year, which are passed in the lower part of our script after Beautiful Soup captures each page's contents. The first snippet ...</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\">page1 = mech.open(url)\n\nhtml1 = page1.read()\n\nsoup1 = BeautifulSoup(html1)\n\nextract(soup1, 2007)</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>...essentially does the same thing as our early versions: visits the URL for my 2007 list and parses out the table. The only change is that the soup variable is now being passed to the extract function along with the year, so that it can be printed alongside the data columns in our output by adding it to the \"record\" list inside the function here:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\">        record = (str(year), rank, artist, album, cover_link)</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>I figured it's a nice add since then our eventual results will contain a field that discerns the 2007 list from the 2006 list. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now check out easy it is to get mechanize to step through to the next page.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\">page2 = mech.follow_link(text_regex=\"Next\")\n\nhtml2 = page2.read()\n\nsoup2 = BeautifulSoup(html2)\n\nextract(soup2, 2006)</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>All it takes is feeding the link's string value to mechanize's follow_link() method and, boom, you're walking over to the next page. Treat what you get back the same as we did our first \"page\" and, bam, you've done it. Save the script, run it, and you should see something more like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">2007|10|LCD Soundsystem|Sound of Silver|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/sound%20of%20silver.jpg\n\n2007|9|Ulrich Schnauss|Goodbye|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/goodbye.jpg\n\n2007|8|The Clientele|God Save The Clientele|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/god%20save%20the%20clientele.jpg\n\n2007|7|The Modernist|Collectors Series Pt. 1: Popular Songs|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/collectors%20series.jpg\n\n2007|6|Bebel Gilberto|Momento|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/memento.jpg\n\n2007|5|Various Artists|Jay Deelicious: 1995-1998|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/jaydeelicious.jpg\n\n2007|4|Lindstrom and Prins Thomas|BBC Essential Mix|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/lindstrom%20prins%20thomas.jpg\n\n2007|3|Go Home Productions|This Was Pop|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/this%20was%20pop.jpg\n\n2007|2|Apparat|Walls|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/walls.jpg\n\n2007|1|Caribou|Andorra|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/andorra.jpg\n\n2006|10|Lily Allen|Alright, Still|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/alright%20still.jpg\n\n2006|9|Nouvelle Vague|Nouvelle Vague|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/nouvelle%20vague.jpg\n\n2006|8|Bookashade|Movements|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/movements.jpg\n\n2006|7|Charlotte Gainsbourg|5:55|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/555.jpg\n\n2006|6|The Drive-By Truckers|The Blessing and the Curse|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/blessing%20and%20curse.jpg\n\n2006|5|Basement Jaxx|Crazy Itch Radio|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/crazy%20itch%20radio.jpg\n\n2006|4|Love is All|Nine Times The Same Song|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/nine%20times.jpg\n\n2006|3|Ewan Pearson|Sci.Fi.Hi.Fi_01|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/sci%20fi%20hi%20fi.jpg\n\n2006|2|Neko Case|Fox Confessor Brings The Flood|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/fox%20confessor.jpg\n\n2006|1|Ellen Allien & Apparat|Orchestra of Bubbles|http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/covers/orchestra%20of%20bubbles.jpg</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now all that's left on our checklist is to figure out a way to download the cover art in addition to recording the urls. When we're interested in just snatching a simple file off the web, I like to use the urlretrieve() function found in Python's urlib module. All you have to do is add it to your import line, as below, and tell it where to save the files. I just stuff it in the extract loop so it pulls down the file immediately after scraping its row in the table. Check it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\">#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nfrom mechanize import Browser\n\nfrom BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup\n\nimport urllib, os\n\n\n\ndef extract(soup, year):\n\n\n\n    table = soup.find(\"table\", border=1)\n\n\n\n    for row in table.findAll('tr')[1:]:\n\n        col = row.findAll('td')\n\n    \n\n        rank = col[0].string\n\n        artist = col[1].string\n\n        album = col[2].string\n\n        cover_link = col[3].img['src']\n\n\n\n        record = (str(year), rank, artist, album, cover_link)\n\n        print >> outfile, \"|\".join(record)\n\n\n\n        save_as = os.path.join(\"./\", album + \".jpg\")\n\n        urllib.urlretrieve(cover_link, save_as)\n\n        print \"Downloaded %s album cover\" % album\n\n       \n\n\n\noutfile = open(\"albums.txt\", \"w\")\n\n\n\nmech = Browser()\n\n\n\nurl = \"http://www.palewire.com/scrape/albums/2007.html\"\n\n\n\npage1 = mech.open(url)\n\nhtml1 = page1.read()\n\nsoup1 = BeautifulSoup(html1)\n\nextract(soup1, 2007)\n\n\n\npage2 = mech.follow_link(text_regex=\"Next\")\n\nhtml2 = page2.read()\n\nsoup2 = BeautifulSoup(html2)\n\nextract(soup2, 2006)\n\n\n\noutfile.close()</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>While I was at it, I also added in an outfile where the scrape results are saved in a text file, just like we did in our previous recipes. Run this version and then check out your working directory, where you should see all the images as well as the new outfile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voila. I think we're done. If this is useful for people, next time we can cover how you leverage these basic tools against search forms and larger result sets. Per usual, if you spot a screw up, or I'm not being clear, just shoot me an email or drop a comment and we'll sort it out. Hope this is helpful to somebody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as a postscript, since we're kind of on a roll here, I thought it might be fun to cook up an LAT version of the <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pythoncook/\">Python Cookbook</a> cover, in the classic O'Reilly style. What do you think? I couldn't quite find the right font.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http://www.palewire.com/images/oreilly_lat.gif\" alt=\"The Reporter's Python Cookbook\" border=1/>",

   "body_html": "<p>Our <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/05/python-recipe-open-a-file-read-through-it-print-each-line-matching-a-search-term/\">first</a> <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/07/python-recipe-open-multiple-files-search-for-matches-count-your-hits-on-the-fly/\">two</a> recipes focused primarily on how to open one or more files and loop through them line by line. While we paid a little attention to how we could search for patterns using <a href=\"http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/regex.html#SECTION000310000000000000000\">regular expressions</a>, we didn't try to do a whole lot with what we caught. Hell, we didn't even try very hard to write a good regex.</p>\n<p>But when you start to get serious about searching for patterns in text, one of the obvious goals is to single out and collect your matches. Maybe you want to pull all the phone numbers out of big blobs of text. Or email addresses. Or anything enclosed in quotation marks. Whatever.</p>\n<p>Here's one way to try it.</p>\n<p>But before we get going, let me just say that I'm going to assume you read the first couple recipes and won't be working too hard to explain the stuff covered there. And keep in mind that my keystrokes are coming right off my home computer, which runs <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu Linux</a>. I'll try to provide Mac and Windows translations as we go, but I might muck a phoneme here and there. If anything is screwed up and doesn't work on your end, just shoot me an email or drop a comment. We'll iron it out.</p>\n<p>Formalities aside, here's the example task I've selected to achieve our mission.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the King James Version of the Holy Bible.</li>\n<li>Read through each line of text.</li>\n<li>Capture each four-letter word.</li>\n<li>Print them out.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let's do it.</p>\n<h2>1. Open the command line, create a working directory, move there.</h2>\n<p>We're going to start the same way we did in the first two lessons, creating a working folder for all our files and moving in with our command line. </p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"nb\">cd </span>Documents/\nmkdir py-search-and-capture\n<span class=\"nb\">cd </span>py-search-and-capture/\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The commands should work just as easily in Mac as in Linux. If you're working in Windows, you'll be on the \"C:/\" file structure, rather than the Unix-style structure above. So you might\"mkdir\" a new working directory in your \"C:/TEMP\" folder or wherever else you'd like to work. Or just make a folder wherever through Windows Explorer and \"cd\" there after the fact through the command line.</p>\n<h2>2. Download our source file, The King James Version of the Holy Bible</h2>\n<p>We're going to use <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10\">the text file</a> provided Project Gutenberg as our source. As in the earlier lessons, I'm going to use the curl command-line utility to retrieve the file, but you should feel free to download it to our working directory using your web browser, if you prefer.</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>curl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext90/kjv10.txt\n</pre></div>\n\n<h2>3. Create our python script in the text editor of your choice.</h2>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>vim search.py\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The line above, which again should work for Linux or Mac, will open a new file in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vim.org%2F&amp;ei=uzoESIj8LKnmpgTRy43VBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8C6iOb5uQLy74YKg-WBd9hikKaw&amp;sig2=vP2XqMTTDBFF49Gy22gxJQ\">vim</a>, the command-line text editor that I prefer. You can follow along, or feel free to make your own file in the application you prefer. If you're a newbie Windows user, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNotepad&amp;ei=zToESKWNL4uqpwT2k73dBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEXWgXDcow8vXjueJBIOmWghv1lhw&amp;sig2=aDintKlEbbRHHWcaHXoz1w\">Notepad</a> should work great.</p>\n<p>If you're following along in vim, you'll need to enter \"insert mode\" so you can start entering text. Do that by hitting:</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>i\n</pre></div>\n\n<h2>4. Write the code!</h2>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"c\">#!/usr/bin/env python</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">re</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">bible</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">open</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;kjv10.txt&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot;r&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">regex</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">re</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">compile</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">r&#39;\\b\\w{4}\\b&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">line</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">bible</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">four_letter_words</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">regex</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">findall</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">line</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">word</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">four_letter_words</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">print</span> <span class=\"n\">word</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Our file opens by importing the re module, which will allow us to call upon Python's regular expression library. We then open our Bible into a variable of the same name and, as in previous recipes, open a loop that will iterate through each line in the file.</p>\n<p>The new stuff comes next. The first statement above our loop uses re's compile method to store our regular expression pattern into a variable called \"regex.\" (As commenter Paddy suggested <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/14/python-recipe-read-a-file-search-for-a-pattern-print-your-matches/#comment-73091\">below</a>, it's a good idea to put it above the loop so it doesn't have to be repeated on each iteration.) Remember, our goal is to match any four-letter words. There are three regex symbols I squished together to give it a hack. They are defined as follows. I've drawn the definitions from <a href=\"http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/regex.html#SECTION000310000000000000000\">this</a> Python reference, which can probably help you crack most nuts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\\b - Word boundary. This is a zero-width assertion that matches only at the beginning or end of a word.</li>\n<li>\\w - Matches any alphanumeric character</li>\n<li>{m,n} - There must be at least m repetitions, and at most n.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So when you piece them together like so, \"\\b\\w{4}\\b\", what you're asking for is any stretch of four alphanumeric characters between two word boundaries. Make sense?</p>\n<p>Next, equipped with our regex, we create another variable called \"four_letter_words.\" In it we see our regex variable pressed against a re method we haven't used before. In the previous lessons we used the kludgy match() function to make our hits. Here we're using something more elegant. It's findall(), which will return all the matches within our line as a list. And by connecting it to our pre-compiled \"regex\" variable, we're setting that as the pattern it should look for. </p>\n<p>We can expect plenty of lines with more than one match, so we'll set up another loop to run through \"four_letter_words\" and print out all the hits. And then we're done. Save and quit out of your script (ESC, SHIFT+ZZ in vim) and fire it up from the command-line:</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>python py-search.py\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>And, voila, there you have it. All the four-letter words in the KJV. Every f*cking one.</p>\n<p>Unless I messed something up, of course. Per usual, if you spot a screw up, or I'm not being clear, just shoot me an email or drop a comment and we'll sort it out. Hope this is helpful to somebody.</p>",

MA tracks a list of over 200,000 Persian language blogs, built initially from a snowball spidering process. 98,875 of these blogs are monitored daily, with all new text and links recorded to a database. Social networks analysis was used to identify the most active and prominent blogs, the top 6018 of which were mapped to identify the core structures of the Iranian blogosphere, create visualizations, and identify blogs for human and computational text analysis. The map (visualization) of the Iranian blogosphere is plotted using the Fruchterman-Rheingold algorithm, which employs a \"physics model\" approach in which blogs that are more densely connected are drawn together into clustered \"network neighborhoods.\" The color of the blogs results from \"Attentive Cluster Analysis,\" in which the linking histories of blogs are compared statistically in order to identify groups sharing similar linking preferences. The largest seven attentive clusters corresponded with major structural features of the Iranian blogosphere, and were selected for qualitative study. Smaller clusters were not studied in-depth, though this would be a worthy topic for future analysis.</blockquote>",

But, first, let's get those mothers out the pdf and onto the Web, where they belong.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>10. \"Against Capital Punishment - Against the Islamic Regime\"</h2>\n\n\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/GtkM2Vx_oGY&amp;hl=en\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/GtkM2Vx_oGY&amp;hl=en\" wmode=\"transparent\"></embed></object>\n\n\n\n<h2>09. \"Mansour Osanloo - Freedom Will Come\"</h2>\n\n\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/in-vF2LvITk&amp;hl=en\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/in-vF2LvITk&amp;hl=en\" wmode=\"transparent\"></embed></object>\n\n\n\n<h2>08. \"Iran ey Sara e Omid\"</h2>\n\n\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/2hWS3gvvLJI&amp;hl=en\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/2hWS3gvvLJI&amp;hl=en\" wmode=\"transparent\"></embed></object>\n\n\n\n<h2>07. \"Mohsen Namjoo\"</h2>\n\n\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/MUnhQOZcqE0&amp;hl=en\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/MUnhQOZcqE0&amp;hl=en\" wmode=\"transparent\"></embed></object>\n\n\n\n<h2>06. \"Nazeri\"</h2>\n\n\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/t3KRHF0_2WU&amp;hl=en\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/t3KRHF0_2WU&amp;hl=en\" wmode=\"transparent\"></embed></object>\n\n\n\n<h2>05. \"Crack in Iran\"</h2>\n\n\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/_Lw5UekabhI&amp;hl=en\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/_Lw5UekabhI&amp;hl=en\" wmode=\"transparent\"></embed></object>\n\n\n\n<h2>04. \"Holy Crime\"</h2>\n\n\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/9R5oLZ8TnWs&amp;hl=en\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/9R5oLZ8TnWs&amp;hl=en\" wmode=\"transparent\"></embed></object>\n\n\n\n<h2>03. \"A girl with a childish voice\"</h2>\n\n\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/40mvtRJBEnA&amp;hl=en\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/40mvtRJBEnA&amp;hl=en\" wmode=\"transparent\"></embed></object>\n\n\n\n<h2>02. \"Akhoond's (Cleric) Comment on Girls.\"</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PRIVATE!

MA tracks a list of over 200,000 Persian language blogs, built initially from a snowball spidering process. 98,875 of these blogs are monitored daily, with all new text and links recorded to a database. Social networks analysis was used to identify the most active and prominent blogs, the top 6018 of which were mapped to identify the core structures of the Iranian blogosphere, create visualizations, and identify blogs for human and computational text analysis. The map (visualization) of the Iranian blogosphere is plotted using the Fruchterman-Rheingold algorithm, which employs a \"physics model\" approach in which blogs that are more densely connected are drawn together into clustered \"network neighborhoods.\" The color of the blogs results from \"Attentive Cluster Analysis,\" in which the linking histories of blogs are compared statistically in order to identify groups sharing similar linking preferences. The largest seven attentive clusters corresponded with major structural features of the Iranian blogosphere, and were selected for qualitative study. Smaller clusters were not studied in-depth, though this would be a worthy topic for future analysis.</blockquote>",

   "title": "Python Recipe: Open files, find matches, count hits.", 
   "author": 1, 
   "body_html": "<p>I got some feedback from our beginners on the <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/05/python-recipe-open-a-file-read-through-it-print-each-line-matching-a-search-term/\">Python recipe</a> I put up yesterday. They had a couple good questions about ways they can branch off, which I think we can cover pretty quick in another post.</p>\n<p>To recap, Saturday's script opened a single file (Shakespeare's sonnets), searched the text line by line for a search term (\"love\") using a basic regular expression, and  then closed by printing the hits to a new text file. Today's recipe will do all that, and a couple other things that might be helpful.</p>\n<p>For reason's discussed in my previous post, I think munching through text with Python is going to be most useful for a reporter when she can leverage its power against large bodies of text.  Our first example only operated on a single file. Out there in the real world, with deadlines, diets and kids to pick up at soccer practice, why should we invest the time learning to write a computer script to process a single file when we might be able to hack out the job with CTRL-F and just be done with it?</p>\n<p>I feel that.</p>\n<p>So, let's take the next step. Let's learn how to crack open a whole directory full of files and slam each one through our wood chipper.</p>\n<p>But before we get going, let me just say that I'm going to assume you read <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/05/python-recipe-open-a-file-read-through-it-print-each-line-matching-a-search-term/\">yesterday's recipe</a> and won't be working too hard to explain the stuff covered there. And keep in mind that my keystrokes are coming right off my home computer, which runs <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu Linux</a>. I'll try to provide Mac and Windows translations as we go, but I might muck a phoneme here and there. If anything is screwed up and doesn't work on your end, just shoot me an email or drop a comment. We'll iron it out.</p>\n<p>Formalities aside, here the example task I've selected to achieve our mission.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the works of Friedrich Nietzsche.</li>\n<li>Train our computer to open the books one by one.</li>\n<li>Read through the text of each.</li>\n<li>Find all the lines that contain the german word for hate (<em>hasse</em>, <em>hasst</em>, <em>hassen</em>)</li>\n<li>Print out the hits.</li>\n<li>Count up the totals for each book and figure which one is the hatenest (<em>das meisten hassten!</em>).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sound good? Let's do it.</p>\n<h2>1. Open the command line, create a working directory, move there.</h2>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"nb\">cd</span> <span class=\"nv\">$HOME</span>/Documents\nmkdir py-search-multiple-files\n<span class=\"nb\">cd </span>py-search-multiple-files/\nmkdir nietzsche\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>We're going to start the same way we did yesterday, creating a working folder for all our files and moving in with our command line. The only difference this time is that we're making an additional subdirectory to hold the source files we'll be searching.</p>\n<p>The commands should work just as easily in Mac as in Linux. If you're working in Windows, you'll be on the \"C:/\" file structure, rather than the Unix-style structure above. So you might \"mkdir\" a new working directory in your \"C:/TEMP\" folder or wherever else you'd like to work. Or just make a folder wherever through Windows Explorer and \"cd\" there after the fact through the command line.</p>\n<h2>2. Download our source files, the works of Friedrich Nietzsche.</h2>\n<p>If you <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/n#a779\">visit Project Gutenberg</a>, you can find variety of Nietzsche's work available for download. For our purposes, we're going to take all of the books available there printed in the author's native tongue, German. We could point and click our way through the process -- visiting each book's profile page and downloading its text to our new nietzsche folder -- but if your aim is to become a big-time computer nerd, you might be interested in a command-line trick that can pull them all down with a single line of code.</p>\n<p>Yesterday we used the curl utility to pull down our Shakespeare file. If you pulled that off, I'm sure you can easily imagine how it could be replicated with each of today's files, provided that you know the right urls to hit. And I'm guessing it might look something like this.</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>curl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7zara10.txt\ncurl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7ecce10.txt\ncurl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7gbrt10.txt\ncurl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7gtzn10.txt\ncurl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7jnst10.txt\ncurl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7msch10.txt\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>But, man, that hardly seems easier that clicking around, does it? Thankfully, one of the great things you pick up as you learn your way around the command line is that there's almost always a way to trim down a repetitive task into an elegant, simple string of code. Here's how those six separate curls can be combined.</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"nb\">cd </span>nietzsche\ncurl -O <span class=\"s2\">&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7{zara,ecce,gbrt,gtzn,jnst,msch}10.txt&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"nb\">cd</span> ..\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Remember how we used the (L|l) option statement in our regular expression yesterday to match our search pattern to phrases containing either an upper or lowercase 'L'? We can do a similar thing here with curl, reducing the six urls to their common parts and providing a list of options between the {}'s where we plug each link's unique string. We just use \"cd\" to commute down to our subdirectory and back. For more details on how curl works, try typing in:</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>curl --help\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>or</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>curl --man\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Each should include instructions on all other sorts of crazy tricks you can pull off. And if you have something in mind, don't forget to ask <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=com.ubuntu%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=bH6&amp;q=curl+tricks+linux&amp;btnG=Search\">our good friend Google</a>.</p>\n<p>If you can't get curl to work on your system, but you still want to play along, just go ahead and download the Nietzsche files one by one through your web browser. As long as you put them in the subdirectory we named after him, the stuff that follows should still work just fine.</p>\n<h2>3. Create our python script in the text editor of your choice.</h2>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>vim search.py\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The line above, which again should work for Linux or Mac, will open a new file in <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.google.com');\" href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vim.org%2F&amp;ei=fI_3R7rdEIHUpgTsleWSAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8C6iOb5uQLy74YKg-WBd9hikKaw&amp;sig2=MmXWcI-I3tIW0vBQUWiXgA\">vim</a>, the command-line text editor that I prefer. You can follow along, or feel free to make your own file in the application you prefer. If you're a newbie Windows user, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad\">Notepad</a> should work great.</p>\n<p>If you're following along in vim, you'll need to enter \"insert mode\" so you can start entering text.  Do that by hitting:</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>i\n</pre></div>\n\n<h2>4. Write the code!</h2>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"c\">#!/usr/bin/env python</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">re</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"nn\">os</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">path</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot;./nietzsche&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"n\">freddys_library</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">os</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">listdir</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">book</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">freddys_library</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"nb\">file</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">os</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">join</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">book</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">text</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">open</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">file</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot;r&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n        <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">line</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n            <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">re</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">match</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;(.*)(hasse|hasst)(.*)&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">line</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n                <span class=\"k\">print</span> <span class=\"n\">line</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Here's what we'll start with. If you cover up the top part of the script with your hand, you'll see that the three statements at the end look almost identical to what we wrote in the first lesson. The script iterates through each line in a file (in this case dubbed \"text\"), seeks out a match using the same methods described in detail yesterday, and then finally prints out cases where we find a hit.</p>\n<p>The only major difference is that we've replaced portions of yesterday's statement designed to seek out variations on the word \"love\" with another quick-fix regex designed to net the common German forms of the word hate (<em>hasse</em>, <em>hasst,</em> <em>hassen</em>).</p>\n<p>And then we've got all that junk up there above it. What's going on there?</p>\n<p>The first thing to notice is that we added another module to the import statement. In addition to the \"re\" module we're using to match regular expressions, we've also introduced the \"<a href=\"http://docs.python.org/lib/module-os.html\">os\" module</a>. The os library hooks you up with a bunch of easy ways to pull in basic information about your operating system and file structure for use in Python. Our next two statements put it to use right away. First we store our nietzsche subdirectory in a variable called \"path,\" which is then passed to the os function listdir(). That will return a list of all the files contained within the directory. Regardless of how few, or how many, are stuffed down in there, the filenames will now all be stored in our second variable, \"freddys_library.\"</p>\n<p>Our next step is to open up a loop that will iterate through each file name in \"freddys_library.\" Since the function simply returns each file's name, not its path, we have to link the two before we can open the file. So the first step is another os function brought in to meld the two. Then we're free to open the file the same way we did yesterday, which leads the way to the search-and-print loop we're already familar with. And since it's stored within the loop stepping through each book's file, it will be repeated for every title before the script ends.</p>\n<p>Now save and quit out of your script (ESC, SHIFT+ZZ in vim) and fire it up from the command-line...</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>python py-search.py\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>...and, voila, you should now have every line in Nietzsche that contains the word hate flying by on your screen.</p>\n<p>Now here's the next set of tricks.</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"c\">#!/usr/bin/env python</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">re</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"nn\">os</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">path</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot;./nietzsche&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"n\">freddys_library</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">os</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">listdir</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">hate</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">open</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;hate.txt&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot;w&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">book</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">freddys_library</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"nb\">file</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">os</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">join</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">book</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">text</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">open</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">file</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot;r&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n    <span class=\"n\">hit_count</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mf\">0</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">line</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">text</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">re</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">match</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;(.*)(hasse|hasst)(.*)&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">line</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">hit_count</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">hit_count</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"mf\">1</span>\n            <span class=\"k\">print</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;&gt;</span>  <span class=\"n\">hate</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">book</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot;|&quot;</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">line</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">print</span> <span class=\"n\">book</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot; =&gt; &quot;</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">hit_count</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">text</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">close</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>This second snippet is identical to our first draft, with a few additions.

So each line in your out file should be labeled with the source file where it was found.</p>\n<p>The second change is to introduce a new \"hit_count\" variable designed to keep a running count of the matches found in each book and report back the results. Since it's enclosed within the outer loop, the first \"hit_count = 0\" variable will reset the number to nil on each book's iteration. And then the placement of \"hit_count + 1\" within the subsequent if statement will click the variable's total up one each time a match is made and the interpreter runs through that portion of the script. The final touch is to close each run through the loop by printing the book's file name along with the total number of hits found after all of the lines had been evaluated.

   "body_markup": "<p>I got some feedback from our beginners on the <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/05/python-recipe-open-a-file-read-through-it-print-each-line-matching-a-search-term/\">Python recipe</a> I put up yesterday. They had a couple good questions about ways they can branch off, which I think we can cover pretty quick in another post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To recap, Saturday's script opened a single file (Shakespeare's sonnets), searched the text line by line for a search term (\"love\") using a basic regular expression, and  then closed by printing the hits to a new text file. Today's recipe will do all that, and a couple other things that might be helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For reason's discussed in my previous post, I think munching through text with Python is going to be most useful for a reporter when she can leverage its power against large bodies of text.  Our first example only operated on a single file. Out there in the real world, with deadlines, diets and kids to pick up at soccer practice, why should we invest the time learning to write a computer script to process a single file when we might be able to hack out the job with CTRL-F and just be done with it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let's take the next step. Let's learn how to crack open a whole directory full of files and slam each one through our wood chipper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we get going, let me just say that I'm going to assume you read <a href=\"http://www.palewire.com/2008/04/05/python-recipe-open-a-file-read-through-it-print-each-line-matching-a-search-term/\">yesterday's recipe</a> and won't be working too hard to explain the stuff covered there. And keep in mind that my keystrokes are coming right off my home computer, which runs <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu Linux</a>. I'll try to provide Mac and Windows translations as we go, but I might muck a phoneme here and there. If anything is screwed up and doesn't work on your end, just shoot me an email or drop a comment. We'll iron it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Formalities aside, here the example task I've selected to achieve our mission.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\n\t<li>Download the works of Friedrich Nietzsche.</li>\n\n\t<li>Train our computer to open the books one by one.</li>\n\n\t<li>Read through the text of each.</li>\n\n\t<li>Find all the lines that contain the german word for hate (<em>hasse</em>, <em>hasst</em>, <em>hassen</em>)</li>\n\n\t<li>Print out the hits.</li>\n\n\t<li>Count up the totals for each book and figure which one is the hatenest (<em>das meisten hassten!</em>).</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Sound good? Let's do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Open the command line, create a working directory, move there.</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">cd $HOME/Documents\n\nmkdir py-search-multiple-files\n\ncd py-search-multiple-files/\n\nmkdir nietzsche</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We're going to start the same way we did yesterday, creating a working folder for all our files and moving in with our command line. The only difference this time is that we're making an additional subdirectory to hold the source files we'll be searching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The commands should work just as easily in Mac as in Linux. If you're working in Windows, you'll be on the \"C:/\" file structure, rather than the Unix-style structure above. So you might \"mkdir\" a new working directory in your \"C:/TEMP\" folder or wherever else you'd like to work. Or just make a folder wherever through Windows Explorer and \"cd\" there after the fact through the command line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Download our source files, the works of Friedrich Nietzsche.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/n#a779\">visit Project Gutenberg</a>, you can find variety of Nietzsche's work available for download. For our purposes, we're going to take all of the books available there printed in the author's native tongue, German. We could point and click our way through the process -- visiting each book's profile page and downloading its text to our new nietzsche folder -- but if your aim is to become a big-time computer nerd, you might be interested in a command-line trick that can pull them all down with a single line of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday we used the curl utility to pull down our Shakespeare file. If you pulled that off, I'm sure you can easily imagine how it could be replicated with each of today's files, provided that you know the right urls to hit. And I'm guessing it might look something like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">curl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7zara10.txt\n\ncurl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7ecce10.txt\n\ncurl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7gbrt10.txt\n\ncurl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7gtzn10.txt\n\ncurl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7jnst10.txt\n\ncurl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7msch10.txt</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>But, man, that hardly seems easier that clicking around, does it? Thankfully, one of the great things you pick up as you learn your way around the command line is that there's almost always a way to trim down a repetitive task into an elegant, simple string of code. Here's how those six separate curls can be combined.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">cd nietzsche\n\ncurl -O \"http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/7{zara,ecce,gbrt,gtzn,jnst,msch}10.txt\"\n\ncd ..</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember how we used the (L|l) option statement in our regular expression yesterday to match our search pattern to phrases containing either an upper or lowercase 'L'? We can do a similar thing here with curl, reducing the six urls to their common parts and providing a list of options between the {}'s where we plug each link's unique string. We just use \"cd\" to commute down to our subdirectory and back. For more details on how curl works, try typing in:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">curl --help</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">curl --man</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Each should include instructions on all other sorts of crazy tricks you can pull off. And if you have something in mind, don't forget to ask <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=com.ubuntu%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=bH6&amp;q=curl+tricks+linux&amp;btnG=Search\">our good friend Google</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can't get curl to work on your system, but you still want to play along, just go ahead and download the Nietzsche files one by one through your web browser. As long as you put them in the subdirectory we named after him, the stuff that follows should still work just fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Create our python script in the text editor of your choice.</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">vim search.py</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The line above, which again should work for Linux or Mac, will open a new file in <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.google.com');\" href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vim.org%2F&amp;ei=fI_3R7rdEIHUpgTsleWSAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8C6iOb5uQLy74YKg-WBd9hikKaw&amp;sig2=MmXWcI-I3tIW0vBQUWiXgA\">vim</a>, the command-line text editor that I prefer. You can follow along, or feel free to make your own file in the application you prefer. If you're a newbie Windows user, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad\">Notepad</a> should work great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're following along in vim, you'll need to enter \"insert mode\" so you can start entering text.  Do that by hitting:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">i</pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Write the code!</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\" line=\"1\" colla=\"+\">#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport re, os\n\n\n\npath = \"./nietzsche\"\n\nfreddys_library = os.listdir(path)\n\n\n\nfor book in freddys_library:\n\n    file = os.path.join(path, book)\n\n    text = open(file, \"r\")\n\n\n\n        for line in text:\n\n            if re.match(\"(.*)(hasse|hasst)(.*)\", line):\n\n                print line,</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here's what we'll start with. If you cover up the top part of the script with your hand, you'll see that the three statements at the end look almost identical to what we wrote in the first lesson. The script iterates through each line in a file (in this case dubbed \"text\"), seeks out a match using the same methods described in detail yesterday, and then finally prints out cases where we find a hit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only major difference is that we've replaced portions of yesterday's statement designed to seek out variations on the word \"love\" with another quick-fix regex designed to net the common German forms of the word hate (<em>hasse</em>, <em>hasst,</em> <em>hassen</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we've got all that junk up there above it. What's going on there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to notice is that we added another module to the import statement. In addition to the \"re\" module we're using to match regular expressions, we've also introduced the \"<a href=\"http://docs.python.org/lib/module-os.html\">os\" module</a>. The os library hooks you up with a bunch of easy ways to pull in basic information about your operating system and file structure for use in Python. Our next two statements put it to use right away. First we store our nietzsche subdirectory in a variable called \"path,\" which is then passed to the os function listdir(). That will return a list of all the files contained within the directory. Regardless of how few, or how many, are stuffed down in there, the filenames will now all be stored in our second variable, \"freddys_library.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our next step is to open up a loop that will iterate through each file name in \"freddys_library.\" Since the function simply returns each file's name, not its path, we have to link the two before we can open the file. So the first step is another os function brought in to meld the two. Then we're free to open the file the same way we did yesterday, which leads the way to the search-and-print loop we're already familar with. And since it's stored within the loop stepping through each book's file, it will be repeated for every title before the script ends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now save and quit out of your script (ESC, SHIFT+ZZ in vim) and fire it up from the command-line...</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\" line=\"1\" colla=\"+\">python py-search.py</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>...and, voila, you should now have every line in Nietzsche that contains the word hate flying by on your screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now here's the next set of tricks.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\" line=\"1\" colla=\"+\">#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport re, os\n\n\n\npath = \"./nietzsche\"\n\nfreddys_library = os.listdir(path)\n\n\n\nhate = open(\"hate.txt\", \"w\")\n\n\n\nfor book in freddys_library:\n\n    file = os.path.join(path, book)\n\n    text = open(file, \"r\")\n\n\n\n    hit_count = 0\n\n    for line in text:\n\n        if re.match(\"(.*)(hasse|hasst)(.*)\", line):\n\n            hit_count = hit_count + 1\n\n            print >>  hate, book + \"|\" + line,\n\n\n\n    print book + \" => \" + str(hit_count)\n\n    text.close()</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This second snippet is identical to our first draft, with a few additions. The simplest change is first, to create a new file (\"hate.txt\") where our matches are now printed. You'll notice that the print statement has also been modified to output the book's file name and a pipe-delimiter along with each hit on hate.

How can you tell the different books apart without memorizing their file names? Good thing we can fix that too. Check out how.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\" line=\"1\" colla=\"+\">#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport re, os\n\n\n\ntitle = {\n\n    \"7ecce10.txt\": \"Ecce homo, Wie man wird, was man\",\n\n    \"7gtzn10.txt\": \"Gotzen-Dammerung\",\n\n    \"7msch10.txt\": \"Menschliches, Allzumenschliches\",\n\n    \"7gbrt10.txt\": \"Die Geburt der Tragodie\",\n\n    \"7jnst10.txt\": \"Jenseits von Gut und Bose\",\n\n    \"7zara10.txt\": \"Also sprach Zarathustra\"\n\n}\n\n\n\npath = \"./nietzsche\"\n\nfreddys_library = os.listdir(path)\n\n\n\nhate = open(\"hate.txt\", \"w\")\n\n\n\nfor book in freddys_library:\n\n    file = os.path.join(path, book)\n\n    text = open(file, \"r\")\n\n\n\n    hit_count = 0\n\n    for line in text:\n\n        if re.match(\"(.*)(hasse|hasst)(.*)\", line):\n\n            hit_count = hit_count + 1\n\n            print >>  hate, title[book] + \"|\" + line,\n\n\n\n    print title[book] + \" => \" + str(hit_count)\n\n    text.close()</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After referring back to our text files to figure out which files contain which books, I made the Python \"dictionary\" at the top of this snippet. It pairs up the files with the titles for later reference, which happens easy peasy there at bottom when the loop's current \"book\" variable is run against the dictionary to return its title for our output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now if you save your changes and fire it off again, you should be getting something more like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">Menschliches, Allzumenschliches => 13\n\nAlso sprach Zarathustra => 34\n\nEcce homo, Wie man wird, was man => 2\n\nGotzen-Dammerung => 5\n\nDie Geburt der Tragodie => 2\n\nJenseits von Gut und Bose => 4</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Much nicer, nein?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright. That's all for tonight. I hope this helps y'all kick the can a little further down the road. Per usual, if I've screwed something up, or I'm not being clear, just shoot me an email or drop a comment and we'll sort it out. Hope this is helpful to somebody.</p>",

Who are they? Hack reporters like me, picking up computer skills in a continuing quest to better sift, organize and analyze information. And, in the process, maybe keep our jobs.</p>\n<p>There are <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.diveintopython.org%2F&amp;ei=soD3R9zRI4_SpgSlvrGXAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQNAs7-XfPQXeZePlQKHmTA13dJQ&amp;sig2=STTYEjUUr__P0LCYzugcqA\">a</a> <a href=\"http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/\">couple</a> great books available free online but it's pretty tough to start stringing all the fundamentals into a problem-solving script all on your own. So why not write up some simple recipes that attack problems common to our particular tribe?</p>\n<p>One of the ways computer programming can be of great use to a reporter is as a text parser. We all have more documents than we have time.  So a common challenge is training your computer to read through a big blob of text and return any hits on terms you're interested in (i.e. the name of the mayor, a popular pesticide, a roster of local police officers).</p>\n<p>If it's a one-off effort, you can probably get this done quickly using search tools included in common quality text editors (ex. <a href=\"http://www.ultraedit.com/\">Ultraedit,</a> <a href=\"http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm\">Notepad++</a>, <a href=\"http://macromates.com/\">TextMate</a>). But if you've got a steady stream of files, like a weekly dump of court filings, or a really big bad file, sometimes it's preferable to train your computer to do the work for you.</p>\n<p>In that spirit, the following instructions are designed to show you how to use Python to search through a text file (The Sonnets of William Shakespeare), find any lines that contain our sample search term (\"love\"), and then print out the hits into a new file we can keep as a memento.</p>\n<p>We'll be dealing with a source file that's probably cleaner than most documents you'll get from the government, and certainly a lot tidier than anything you've converted from a PDF file using an <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FOCR&amp;ei=Don3R6TqA5OkpwTwr-B-&amp;usg=AFQjCNHMFPblFGTHSM76WDSX2SkNbxkqaQ&amp;sig2=uwlPh0CUVchwL5Hp_rDZ4Q\">OCR</a> application, but if you're a totally newbie, my hope is that this can help you get a grip on how the hell all the pieces described in the textbooks fit together into something almost useful.</p>\n<p>Since I'm now a full-time geek, I do most of my work on computers that run some flavor of Linux. The step-by-step instructions that follow will walk you through each keystroke on the command line in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=3&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FUbuntu_(Linux_distribution)&amp;ei=t4j3R8z6IKi-pgSXhtF3&amp;usg=AFQjCNEm1W3O1_OsDnkAl5emlxHmgPxPAQ&amp;sig2=f8zSJLp9T0AquKr-oWMTPg\">Ubuntu</a>, which is what I run at home. But since most people who might be interested in this are probably running Windows XP or Mac OS X, I'll try to include translations as we go.</p>\n<p>The one prerequsite for the whole endeavor is that you already have a working installation of Python. If you're working in Windows and you don't, I'd recommend visiting <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/Products/activepython/\">ActiveState</a> and downloading the installer for their ActivePython distribution. If you're rocking a Macbook, you can find out whether you're rolling with Python by opening your terminal and entering the following:</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>which python\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>If you've got it properly installed, it should return something like</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>/usr/bin/python\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>If it's not working out, I'd recommend <a href=\"http://www.diveintopython.org/installing_python/index.html\">the installation instructions</a> in Mark Pilgrim's excellent book, Dive Into Python.</p>\n<p>Alright, with all that out of the way, let's get to the recipe.</p>\n<h2>1. Open the command line, create a working directory, move there.</h2>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"nb\">cd</span> <span class=\"nv\">$HOME</span>\nmkdir Documents/py-search\n<span class=\"nb\">cd </span>Documents/py-search\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The three commands above, which should work just as easily in Mac as in Linux, will move us to our home directory, create a new subdirectory in your Documents folder, and relocate to the new folder.</p>\n<p>If you're working in Windows, you'll be on the \"C:/\" file structure, rather than the Unix-style structure above. So you might \"mkdir\" a new working directory in your \"C:/TEMP\" folder or wherever else you'd like to work. Or just make a folder wherever through Windows Explorer and \"cd\" there after the fact through the command line.</p>\n<h2>2. Download our source file, The Sonnets of William Shakespeare.</h2>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>curl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext97/wssnt10.txt\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The line above uses the curl command line utility to download a copy of Shakespeare's work from the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gutenberg.org%2F&amp;ei=BI73R6_pPISmpwTs8qiGAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwWvhQCQqfxd5f1CbKz4kDmWOgtw&amp;sig2=zRLSSO5_tlJUa4Q_YjXXRQ\">Project Gutenberg</a> Web site. Mac users with curl installed should be able to issue the same command. Windows users, or anyone without curl, will probably be able to most easily snatch the file just by visiting <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext97/wssnt10.txt\">the link</a> in a web browser and saving the file to the working directory created in step one.</p>\n<h2>3. Create our python script in the text editor of your choice.</h2>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>vim py-search.py\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>The line above, which again should work for Linux or Mac, will open a new file in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vim.org%2F&amp;ei=fI_3R7rdEIHUpgTsleWSAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8C6iOb5uQLy74YKg-WBd9hikKaw&amp;sig2=MmXWcI-I3tIW0vBQUWiXgA\">vim</a>, the command-line text editor that I prefer. You can follow along, or feel free to make your own file in the application you prefer. If you're a newbie Windows user, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad\">Notepad</a> should work great.</p>\n<p>If you're following along in vim, you'll need to enter \"insert mode\" so you can start entering text.  Do that by hitting:</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>i\n</pre></div>\n\n<h2>4. Write the code!</h2>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre><span class=\"c\">#!/usr/bin/env python</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">re</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">shakes</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">open</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;wssnt10.txt&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot;r&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">line</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">shakes</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">re</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">match</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;(.*)(L|l)ove(.*)&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">line</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">print</span> <span class=\"n\">line</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>If, like my friends, you've been working through some common Python tutorials, I'm guessing a lot of that looks familar to you.</p>\n<p>The first line is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)\">\"shebang\"</a> that, on execution of the file, instructs the computer to process the script using the python interpreter. The \"import re\" pulls in <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/lib/module-re.html\">Python's standard regular expression module</a> so we can use it later to search the text. The open() command grabs the Shakespeare file we've just downloaded and opens it up. The \"r\" is for read mode.</p>\n<p>The three staggered statements that follow are a loop that runs through each line in the document, as dictated by the first statement. The second statement uses <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.regular-expressions.info%2Fpython.html&amp;ei=qJT3R9GRFabopASVx7yOAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHl7XwdC7m3xt26uu6oInBwYX1lOw&amp;sig2=SgkINQJUbkJB1FIERp8qmw\">the re.match() function</a> we imported at the top to evaluate the latest line on each iteration through the loop by testing it against that scary looking mess in its first parameter.</p>\n<p>So, what is that thing? \"(.*)(L|l)ove(.*)\", say what?</p>\n<p>That's a regular expression I designed specifically to catch any instances of the search term I'm after.  If you're not familar with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\">regular expressions</a>, they're a powerful language for matching strings of text. When you first get started, they can be a bit intimidating, but once you learn a couple tricks, you'll quickly see how useful they can be. One of my favorite geek jokes is <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/208/\">this cartoon</a> on the utility of a well-timed \"regex\"</p>\n<p>So how does it work? There are two tricks to learn. Remember, our goal is to find any line in Shakespeare's sonnets that include the word love. But, when we think about it, we can't just search for \"love\" because our loop is evaluating the text line by line, not word by word. So if we just ask for \"love,\" we'd only get lines that include <em>only</em> the word \"love.\" Plus the word could appear in any number of common grammatical variations (ex. \"Love,\" \"lover,\" \"lovesick,\" \"self-love\") that we'd also like to capture.</p>\n<p>That's where the regular expressions come in. You'll notice that the expression is bracketed by two \"(.*)\" statements. In regular expression language, the \".\" command matches any string and the \"*\" repeats whatever command precedes it zero or more times, so together they will match any string of any length. When bracketed around a search term, like \"love,\" it should return a match on a line of text regardless of where in the line \"love\" appears. In other words, it would match <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO9GB_KUAQI\">\"She loves you,\"</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLv_VaTGxH0\">\"love is a many spendored thing\"</a> or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzB-3oKIfRw\">\"ain't talking 'bout love.\"</a></p>\n<p>But, all by itself \"(.*)love(.*) wouldn't match <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrvNzH9aaUE\">\"America: What Time is Love?\"</a> or  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50EALZU4D6A\">\"Love Is Only A Feeling.\"</a> Why not? Because those songs have an uppercase L and we're just asking for lowercase. Bummer, right?</p>\n<p>One way to fix that would be to add an option that gives the regular expression variations on the term to look for. You can do that by adding another parenthesis set and separating the options with a \"|\" pipe. That's where the \"(L|l)\" above came from. Combine that with the (.*) commands and we should have a quick and dirty regex to catch the lines we're after. Though quick studies will catch a flaw in the design. As we'll see in our result set later, this sort of dragnet approach will also yield hits on things we might not want to catch, words like \"glove\" and \"lovely\" will match just as easily as \"lovesick\" or \"lover.\" Feel free to tweak the statement and try to finetune your results. There's a ton more you can do with regular expressions than what I've described. So don't take my example too seriously. I just wanted to show off a couple of the most common regex commands.</p>\n<h2>5. Save your script and run it.</h2>\n<p>If you're working along with me in vim, you'll need to save your work before exiting. The easiest way to do that is to exit insert mode by hitting the ESC key and then hold SHIFT and hit the Z key twice in a row.  If you're working in your own text editor, just save it however you're comfortable.</p>\n<p>Now jump back onto the command line resting in your working directory and tell python to fire that mother off.</p>\n<div class=\"source\"><pre>python py-search.py\n</pre></div>\n\n<p>Voila. There they are, flying across your screen is every line in Shakespeare's sonnets containing the word love.

   "body_markup": "<p>A couple of friends out there are valiantly teaching themselves the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=3&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPython_(programming_language)&amp;ei=dYn3R_GUHYyKpwTA2uSCAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9Zj5BO1JqfEoXtYHusciWciPhyw&amp;sig2=wUObhPmolLlcHaWLfM2jIQ\">Python</a> programming language in their free time. Who are they? Hack reporters like me, picking up computer skills in a continuing quest to better sift, organize and analyze information. And, in the process, maybe keep our jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.diveintopython.org%2F&amp;ei=soD3R9zRI4_SpgSlvrGXAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQNAs7-XfPQXeZePlQKHmTA13dJQ&amp;sig2=STTYEjUUr__P0LCYzugcqA\">a</a> <a href=\"http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/\">couple</a> great books available free online but it's pretty tough to start stringing all the fundamentals into a problem-solving script all on your own. So why not write up some simple recipes that attack problems common to our particular tribe?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the ways computer programming can be of great use to a reporter is as a text parser. We all have more documents than we have time.  So a common challenge is training your computer to read through a big blob of text and return any hits on terms you're interested in (i.e. the name of the mayor, a popular pesticide, a roster of local police officers).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it's a one-off effort, you can probably get this done quickly using search tools included in common quality text editors (ex. <a href=\"http://www.ultraedit.com/\">Ultraedit,</a> <a href=\"http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm\">Notepad++</a>, <a href=\"http://macromates.com/\">TextMate</a>). But if you've got a steady stream of files, like a weekly dump of court filings, or a really big bad file, sometimes it's preferable to train your computer to do the work for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that spirit, the following instructions are designed to show you how to use Python to search through a text file (The Sonnets of William Shakespeare), find any lines that contain our sample search term (\"love\"), and then print out the hits into a new file we can keep as a memento.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We'll be dealing with a source file that's probably cleaner than most documents you'll get from the government, and certainly a lot tidier than anything you've converted from a PDF file using an <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FOCR&amp;ei=Don3R6TqA5OkpwTwr-B-&amp;usg=AFQjCNHMFPblFGTHSM76WDSX2SkNbxkqaQ&amp;sig2=uwlPh0CUVchwL5Hp_rDZ4Q\">OCR</a> application, but if you're a totally newbie, my hope is that this can help you get a grip on how the hell all the pieces described in the textbooks fit together into something almost useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since I'm now a full-time geek, I do most of my work on computers that run some flavor of Linux. The step-by-step instructions that follow will walk you through each keystroke on the command line in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=3&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FUbuntu_(Linux_distribution)&amp;ei=t4j3R8z6IKi-pgSXhtF3&amp;usg=AFQjCNEm1W3O1_OsDnkAl5emlxHmgPxPAQ&amp;sig2=f8zSJLp9T0AquKr-oWMTPg\">Ubuntu</a>, which is what I run at home. But since most people who might be interested in this are probably running Windows XP or Mac OS X, I'll try to include translations as we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one prerequsite for the whole endeavor is that you already have a working installation of Python. If you're working in Windows and you don't, I'd recommend visiting <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/Products/activepython/\">ActiveState</a> and downloading the installer for their ActivePython distribution. If you're rocking a Macbook, you can find out whether you're rolling with Python by opening your terminal and entering the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">which python</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If you've got it properly installed, it should return something like</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">/usr/bin/python</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If it's not working out, I'd recommend <a href=\"http://www.diveintopython.org/installing_python/index.html\">the installation instructions</a> in Mark Pilgrim's excellent book, Dive Into Python.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, with all that out of the way, let's get to the recipe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Open the command line, create a working directory, move there.</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">cd $HOME\n\nmkdir Documents/py-search\n\ncd Documents/py-search</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The three commands above, which should work just as easily in Mac as in Linux, will move us to our home directory, create a new subdirectory in your Documents folder, and relocate to the new folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're working in Windows, you'll be on the \"C:/\" file structure, rather than the Unix-style structure above. So you might \"mkdir\" a new working directory in your \"C:/TEMP\" folder or wherever else you'd like to work. Or just make a folder wherever through Windows Explorer and \"cd\" there after the fact through the command line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Download our source file, The Sonnets of William Shakespeare.</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">curl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext97/wssnt10.txt</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The line above uses the curl command line utility to download a copy of Shakespeare's work from the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gutenberg.org%2F&amp;ei=BI73R6_pPISmpwTs8qiGAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwWvhQCQqfxd5f1CbKz4kDmWOgtw&amp;sig2=zRLSSO5_tlJUa4Q_YjXXRQ\">Project Gutenberg</a> Web site. Mac users with curl installed should be able to issue the same command. Windows users, or anyone without curl, will probably be able to most easily snatch the file just by visiting <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext97/wssnt10.txt\">the link</a> in a web browser and saving the file to the working directory created in step one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Create our python script in the text editor of your choice.</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">vim py-search.py</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The line above, which again should work for Linux or Mac, will open a new file in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vim.org%2F&amp;ei=fI_3R7rdEIHUpgTsleWSAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8C6iOb5uQLy74YKg-WBd9hikKaw&amp;sig2=MmXWcI-I3tIW0vBQUWiXgA\">vim</a>, the command-line text editor that I prefer. You can follow along, or feel free to make your own file in the application you prefer. If you're a newbie Windows user, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad\">Notepad</a> should work great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're following along in vim, you'll need to enter \"insert mode\" so you can start entering text.  Do that by hitting:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Bash\">i</pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Write the code!</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre lang=\"Python\" line=\"1\" colla=\"+\">#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport re\n\n\n\nshakes = open(\"wssnt10.txt\", \"r\")\n\n\n\nfor line in shakes:\n\n    if re.match(\"(.*)(L|l)ove(.*)\", line):\n\n        print line,</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If, like my friends, you've been working through some common Python tutorials, I'm guessing a lot of that looks familar to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first line is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)\">\"shebang\"</a> that, on execution of the file, instructs the computer to process the script using the python interpreter. The \"import re\" pulls in <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/lib/module-re.html\">Python's standard regular expression module</a> so we can use it later to search the text. The open() command grabs the Shakespeare file we've just downloaded and opens it up. The \"r\" is for read mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three staggered statements that follow are a loop that runs through each line in the document, as dictated by the first statement. The second statement uses <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.regular-expressions.info%2Fpython.html&amp;ei=qJT3R9GRFabopASVx7yOAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHl7XwdC7m3xt26uu6oInBwYX1lOw&amp;sig2=SgkINQJUbkJB1FIERp8qmw\">the re.match() function</a> we imported at the top to evaluate the latest line on each iteration through the loop by testing it against that scary looking mess in its first parameter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what is that thing? \"(.*)(L|l)ove(.*)\", say what?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's a regular expression I designed specifically to catch any instances of the search term I'm after.  If you're not familar with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\">regular expressions</a>, they're a powerful language for matching strings of text. When you first get started, they can be a bit intimidating, but once you learn a couple tricks, you'll quickly see how useful they can be. One of my favorite geek jokes is <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/208/\">this cartoon</a> on the utility of a well-timed \"regex\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how does it work? There are two tricks to learn. Remember, our goal is to find any line in Shakespeare's sonnets that include the word love. But, when we think about it, we can't just search for \"love\" because our loop is evaluating the text line by line, not word by word. So if we just ask for \"love,\" we'd only get lines that include <em>only</em> the word \"love.\" Plus the word could appear in any number of common grammatical variations (ex. \"Love,\" \"lover,\" \"lovesick,\" \"self-love\") that we'd also like to capture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's where the regular expressions come in. You'll notice that the expression is bracketed by two \"(.*)\" statements. In regular expression language, the \".\" command matches any string and the \"*\" repeats whatever command precedes it zero or more times, so together they will match any string of any length. When bracketed around a search term, like \"love,\" it should return a match on a line of text regardless of where in the line \"love\" appears. In other words, it would match <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO9GB_KUAQI\">\"She loves you,\"</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLv_VaTGxH0\">\"love is a many spendored thing\"</a> or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzB-3oKIfRw\">\"ain't talking 'bout love.\"</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, all by itself \"(.*)love(.*) wouldn't match <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrvNzH9aaUE\">\"America: What Time is Love?\"</a> or  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50EALZU4D6A\">\"Love Is Only A Feeling.\"</a> Why not? Because those songs have an uppercase L and we're just asking for lowercase. Bummer, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to fix that would be to add an option that gives the regular expression variations on the term to look for. You can do that by adding another parenthesis set and separating the options with a \"|\" pipe. That's where the \"(L|l)\" above came from. Combine that with the (.*) commands and we should have a quick and dirty regex to catch the lines we're after. Though quick studies will catch a flaw in the design. As we'll see in our result set later, this sort of dragnet approach will also yield hits on things we might not want to catch, words like \"glove\" and \"lovely\" will match just as easily as \"lovesick\" or \"lover.\" Feel free to tweak the statement and try to finetune your results. There's a ton more you can do with regular expressions than what I've described. So don't take my example too seriously. I just wanted to show off a couple of the most common regex commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.

Passport files do not contain travel information, such as visa and entry stamps, from previous passports. Almost all passport files contain only a passport application form as completed by the applicant.</blockquote>\n<p>And, according to Under Secretary of State for Management <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdosfan.lib.uic.edu%2FERC%2Fbiographies%2Fkennedy.html&amp;ei=PLDnR6PfM52ypgTrr_2YBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFcxZqkgvTu4fPWL8YrDbzc6h_uZA&amp;sig2=-VkRTRLCD5lRQYg_RvD2Vw\" target=\"_blank\">Patrick F. Kennedy</a>, here's what the paper trail looks like.</p>\n<blockquote>When you send in your passport application, it might go to a State Department office around the country, it might go to a clerk of the court, it might go to a library or a post office. That information is -- your application is assembled with others and transmitted via registered mail, via Federal Express -- all of it is traceable -- to one of our facilities, a facility such as the one that we work with the Department of the Treasury on in Newark, Delaware . And the information then is -- the envelopes are opened, the checks are removed so that they can be deposited to the Treasury's account, and then they are processed for onward transmission to one of the State Department's facilities that actually print out the passport books in your name (<a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/coffee/102504.htm\">Source</a>).</blockquote>\n<p>If you review <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/100004.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the passport application form</a>, you're not going to find much more than what's printed on your driver's license. At first blush, that hardly seems like the sort of thing that contains much to get excited about.</p>\n<p>But, being good paranoids, we should be sure to note the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word\">weasel words</a> in the State Department's blog post. They are \"generally\" and \"almost all,\" which I can only take to mean that while most passport files may only contain the application form, some files contain other documents. What documents those are, it doesn't say.</p>\n<p>On <a href=\"&amp;eurl=http://dandelionsalad.wordpress.com/2008/03/20/olbermann-obamas-passport-breach/\" target=\"_blank\">this particularly alarmist segment of The Countdown with Keith Olbermann</a>, the host and his guests seem to think there's the potential for quite a lot more to be in there. (In a memorable bit of hype, Keith speculates that the file might be of \"Watergatian\" proportions). On the other hand, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1724759,00.html?imw=Y\" target=\"_blank\">the reporting of Time's Brian Bennett</a> seems more in line with the State Department's blog.</p>\n<p>But hell if I know.</p>\n<p>The good news is that we live in a free country, governed by laws, one of the best of which is <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gwu.edu%2F~nsarchiv%2Fnsa%2Ffoia.html&amp;ei=zK3nR__WB4WIpATamp2ZBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNETE0mlrhsTBkE-4Y0vG6jSlWdzvQ&amp;sig2=QGJ-0STQGz92YeZ3wRFlvw\" target=\"_blank\">the Freedom of Information Act</a> (a.k.a FOIA). And, thereby, we all have the right to review government documents pertaining to ourselves.</p>\n<p>So, getting to the bottom of this should only be a matter of paperwork and collective effort. Below is a form letter I've prepared using<a href=\"http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/86672.pdf\"> the State Department's FOIA handbook</a> as a guide. I've already filled in my own information and will, later today, mail it off as a formal request.</p>\n<p>You should feel free to do the same. Just don't expect a rapid response. <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/100129.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The State Department annual report</a> says the median response time on a typical request last year was 212 days. (Though, if you're willing to pay a little more money, the State Department's manual suggests you might get your documents quicker if you bypass FOIA law and make your document request with <a href=\"http://travel.state.gov/passport\" target=\"_blank\">the Passport Services office</a>.)</p>\n<p>If you want to share what you get back, drop a comment when the time comes.

Passport files do not contain travel information, such as visa and entry stamps, from previous passports. Almost all passport files contain only a passport application form as completed by the applicant.</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And, according to Under Secretary of State for Management <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdosfan.lib.uic.edu%2FERC%2Fbiographies%2Fkennedy.html&amp;ei=PLDnR6PfM52ypgTrr_2YBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFcxZqkgvTu4fPWL8YrDbzc6h_uZA&amp;sig2=-VkRTRLCD5lRQYg_RvD2Vw\" target=\"_blank\">Patrick F. Kennedy</a>, here's what the paper trail looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>When you send in your passport application, it might go to a State Department office around the country, it might go to a clerk of the court, it might go to a library or a post office. That information is -- your application is assembled with others and transmitted via registered mail, via Federal Express -- all of it is traceable -- to one of our facilities, a facility such as the one that we work with the Department of the Treasury on in Newark, Delaware . And the information then is -- the envelopes are opened, the checks are removed so that they can be deposited to the Treasury's account, and then they are processed for onward transmission to one of the State Department's facilities that actually print out the passport books in your name (<a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/coffee/102504.htm\">Source</a>).</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you review <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/100004.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the passport application form</a>, you're not going to find much more than what's printed on your driver's license. At first blush, that hardly seems like the sort of thing that contains much to get excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, being good paranoids, we should be sure to note the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word\">weasel words</a> in the State Department's blog post. They are \"generally\" and \"almost all,\" which I can only take to mean that while most passport files may only contain the application form, some files contain other documents. What documents those are, it doesn't say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On <a href=\"&amp;eurl=http://dandelionsalad.wordpress.com/2008/03/20/olbermann-obamas-passport-breach/\" target=\"_blank\">this particularly alarmist segment of The Countdown with Keith Olbermann</a>, the host and his guests seem to think there's the potential for quite a lot more to be in there. (In a memorable bit of hype, Keith speculates that the file might be of \"Watergatian\" proportions). On the other hand, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1724759,00.html?imw=Y\" target=\"_blank\">the reporting of Time's Brian Bennett</a> seems more in line with the State Department's blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But hell if I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that we live in a free country, governed by laws, one of the best of which is <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gwu.edu%2F~nsarchiv%2Fnsa%2Ffoia.html&amp;ei=zK3nR__WB4WIpATamp2ZBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNETE0mlrhsTBkE-4Y0vG6jSlWdzvQ&amp;sig2=QGJ-0STQGz92YeZ3wRFlvw\" target=\"_blank\">the Freedom of Information Act</a> (a.k.a FOIA). And, thereby, we all have the right to review government documents pertaining to ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, getting to the bottom of this should only be a matter of paperwork and collective effort. Below is a form letter I've prepared using<a href=\"http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/86672.pdf\"> the State Department's FOIA handbook</a> as a guide. I've already filled in my own information and will, later today, mail it off as a formal request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should feel free to do the same. Just don't expect a rapid response. <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/100129.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The State Department annual report</a> says the median response time on a typical request last year was 212 days. (Though, if you're willing to pay a little more money, the State Department's manual suggests you might get your documents quicker if you bypass FOIA law and make your document request with <a href=\"http://travel.state.gov/passport\" target=\"_blank\">the Passport Services office</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to share what you get back, drop a comment when the time comes. I'll be sure to do the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>[Today's Date]\n\n<br><br>\n\n[Your Name]<br>\n\n[Your Street Address]<br>\n\n[Your City, State and Zipcode]<br>\n\n<br><br>\n\nOffice of Information Programs and Services\n\n<br><br>\n\nA/ISS/IPS<br>\n\nDepartment of State, SA-2<br>\n\nWashington, DC 20522-8001<br>\n\nRe: Freedom of Information Act Request<br>\n\n<br><br>\n\nDear Sir or Madame:\n\n<br><br>\n\nI am writing to request the release of personal records under the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n<br><br>\n\nI, [Your Name], born [Your Place of Birth] on [Your Date of Birth], request the release of any and all documents contained in my passport file.

It focuses on his success promoting pathbreaking pop groups like The Sex Pistols, Joy Division, New Order and  The Happy Mondays.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While there are some fun moments with the man himself, I was struck by how heavily the producers relied upon clips from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tca2JkjsZHU\" target=\"_blank\">\"24 Hour Party People,\"</a> the excellent biopic about Wilson starring Steve Coogan.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Nevermind that the movie was a work of fiction. Or that Coogan's version of Wilson is an unreliable narrator with a nearly pathological commitment to self-mythologizing. When a moment calls for video to illustrate qualities of Wilson's personality or events from his life, the producers jump for the legend more frequently than the fact.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And, as much as this tweaks my inner journalism professor, I think I can understand where the TV producers were coming from. I'll try to offer it here as a 2007 update to Ford's maxim.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>This is TV, stupid. When the tape is hot, run the tape.</blockquote>",

   "author": 1, 
   "body_html": "<p>Last weekend I ran through James Mann's new book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/China-Fantasy-Leaders-Explain-Repression/dp/0670038253/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-4055846-9649705?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1183229012&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\">The China Fantasy</a>.</p>\n<p>His point is pretty simple. China is ruled by a repressive, single-party system. And, despite what George Bush or Thomas Friedman might tell you, there's a pretty good chance that may not change anytime soon.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the book walks through Mann's arguments against past and present American accommodation of the current Chinese regime. His main villain is the common theory that China's boom in economic development is almost certain to act as the catalyst for democratic reforms. Mann says maybe, but maybe not.</p>\n<p>I won't go any further unpacking his argument. (If you're interested in learning more, you can borrow my copy of the book. It's short enough that you can burn through it on a bus ride from DC to New York City, as I did last Saturday. Or you can get a taste of Mann's argument by reading <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/18/AR2007051801640.html\" target=\"_blank\">an Op-Ed he wrote</a> for the Washington Post last month.) But one interesting thing I would like to share is this prediction Mann throws out near the book's ending. I'm curious to watch this play out in the media next year in the run up to the Beijing Olympics.</p>\n<blockquote>Before the summer Olympics, as visitors are preparing to come to Beijing, Chinese leaders will undoubtedly tell the world that change is coming, that their political system is opening up. They will, in fact, probably take some tantalizing actions, ones that hold out the prospect for far-reaching change. In the spring of 2008, China's newspapers and other news media may, for a time, be permitted unprecedented freedom. At Chinese universities and think tanks, intellectuals will launch new explorations of the concept of checks and restraints on the power of the ruling Chinese Communist Party -- for example, by increasing the power of the National People's Congress, China's toothless legislature. In general, as the Olympics approach, there will probably be a period of greater tolerance for dissent and for political opposition.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThis is the China that will be on display for tens of thousands of visitors who come to Beijing for the Olympics. China's leaders will want the visitors to see a country that is enlightened, open-minded, and on the verge of far-reaching political change. The first test for the regime, as mentioned previously, will be whether it can protect its image during the games by keeping its citizenry under control. If things work out right, the foreign guests will never see or know how hard China's Miinistry of State Security is working to prevent anything untoward -- a large-scale political demonstration, for example -- from disrupting the games.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nThe real test, however, will come not in the summer of 2008, but in the year or two after all the visitors go home. How many of the changes in China's political system hinted at on the eve of the Olympics will actually be implemented? How much of the predictable Beijing spring of 2008 will last until 2009 or 2010?</blockquote>",

   "title": "Who is the Daily Muckiest?", 
   "author": 1, 
   "body_html": "<p>One of the hits I make each day as part of my morning reading is <a href=\"http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/cats/the_daily_muck/\">The Daily Muck</a>. It's a quick and easy digest of investigative news stories published by one of the hotter political blogs, <a href=\"http://www.tpmmuckraker.com\">TPMmuckraker.com</a>.</p>\n<p>I doubt it's anywhere near as well-read as other tip sheets like the <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com/\">Drudge Report</a> or <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/TheNote/story?id=3105267&amp;page=1\">The Note</a>, but I find it to be a good way to keep tabs on the pulse of Washington, particularly what issues are resonating with the young, left-of-center types embodied by the site's leader, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Marshall\">Josh Marshall</a>.</p>\n<p>Marshall's greatest claim to fame is his site's role in driving the scandal currently nagging at Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez. There is a conventional wisdom already taking shape in Washington. It <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/04272007/transcript2.html\">goes</a> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9083501\" target=\"_blank\">like</a> <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-blogs17mar17,0,4018765,full.story?coll=la-home-headlines\">this</a>: By collecting, digesting and analyzing a wide menu of news stories from across the country, Marshall and his fellow bloggers were the first journalists to connect all of the dots and press for greater inquiry into the Department of Justice's firing of a number of high-level prosecutors.</p>\n<p>As the story goes, TPM's virtue wasn't in discovering any new information (though they have done that).  Instead they're credited for their assiduous job of surveying the information available and pressing their conclusions.</p>\n<p>Thinking about this got me interested in knowing a little bit more about where they get their information and what sources they favor.</p>\n<p>So this morning I fired off a quick experiment.

   "body_markup": "<p>One of the hits I make each day as part of my morning reading is <a href=\"http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/cats/the_daily_muck/\">The Daily Muck</a>. It's a quick and easy digest of investigative news stories published by one of the hotter political blogs, <a href=\"http://www.tpmmuckraker.com\">TPMmuckraker.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I doubt it's anywhere near as well-read as other tip sheets like the <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com/\">Drudge Report</a> or <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/TheNote/story?id=3105267&amp;page=1\">The Note</a>, but I find it to be a good way to keep tabs on the pulse of Washington, particularly what issues are resonating with the young, left-of-center types embodied by the site's leader, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Marshall\">Josh Marshall</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marshall's greatest claim to fame is his site's role in driving the scandal currently nagging at Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez. There is a conventional wisdom already taking shape in Washington. It <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/04272007/transcript2.html\">goes</a> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9083501\" target=\"_blank\">like</a> <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-blogs17mar17,0,4018765,full.story?coll=la-home-headlines\">this</a>: By collecting, digesting and analyzing a wide menu of news stories from across the country, Marshall and his fellow bloggers were the first journalists to connect all of the dots and press for greater inquiry into the Department of Justice's firing of a number of high-level prosecutors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the story goes, TPM's virtue wasn't in discovering any new information (though they have done that).  Instead they're credited for their assiduous job of surveying the information available and pressing their conclusions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thinking about this got me interested in knowing a little bit more about where they get their information and what sources they favor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this morning I fired off a quick experiment.

You'll find a good and pretty darn funny example in <a href=\"http://www.thetvset.net/\" target=\"_blank\">The TV Set</a>, a smart ring-up of the vulgarities of network television I caught tonight at E Street Cinema down by Ford's Theatre.</p>\n<p>While hardly a new theme -- artist meets suit, integrity meets compromise --  I enjoyed how the conflict was brought to life by dramatizing the way coercion and criticism can be cloaked in the rhetoric of persuasion and euphemism.</p>\n<p>When the imperious network executive (Sigourney Weaver) wants to dumb down the pet project of an earnest writer (David Duchovny), she doesn't directly confront him with her demands. His will is slowly bent through a series of passive-aggressive maneuvers that erode his resistance and are undertaken with a smile sandwiched between empty compliments. Looming at every turn, of course, is the unspoken knowledge that one side of the table is holding all of the cards.</p>\n<p>Unlike other recent workplace satires like The Office or Dilbert, where bureaucratic gamesmanship and corporate happy talk are depicted as the shield and song of the incompetent, The TV Set aims to show how it can also be the sword of the ambitious and the powerful.

You'll find a good and pretty darn funny example in <a href=\"http://www.thetvset.net/\" target=\"_blank\">The TV Set</a>, a smart ring-up of the vulgarities of network television I caught tonight at E Street Cinema down by Ford's Theatre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While hardly a new theme -- artist meets suit, integrity meets compromise --  I enjoyed how the conflict was brought to life by dramatizing the way coercion and criticism can be cloaked in the rhetoric of persuasion and euphemism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the imperious network executive (Sigourney Weaver) wants to dumb down the pet project of an earnest writer (David Duchovny), she doesn't directly confront him with her demands. His will is slowly bent through a series of passive-aggressive maneuvers that erode his resistance and are undertaken with a smile sandwiched between empty compliments. Looming at every turn, of course, is the unspoken knowledge that one side of the table is holding all of the cards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike other recent workplace satires like The Office or Dilbert, where bureaucratic gamesmanship and corporate happy talk are depicted as the shield and song of the incompetent, The TV Set aims to show how it can also be the sword of the ambitious and the powerful. Plus it's really funny.</p>",

If you divide that number by 365 you get 31.9, which is how many pages someone would have to read every single day of the year to finish all 31 books.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Impressive enough, right? Does anyone here read more than 30 pages a day?</p>\n<p>Yet, remember, the claim isn't that President Bush read 31 books last year. No, the claim is that he read 60 books - and all of them by August 20.</p>\n<p>Without knowing the complete list of titles, it's impossible to generate an exact page total. One alternative is to assume that the rest of the books were of approximately the same length as the titles we do know. The average length of the 31 books listed above is just over 375 pages. Since we're 29 books short of our total, let's multiply that by 375, which rounds out to about 10,895 additional pages of reading. That nearly doubles our earlier total of 11,647 up to an estimated 22,543 pages of reading.</p>\n<p>A quick run through the calendar shows August 20 to have been the 232nd day of the year. What's 22,543 divided by 232? It's 97. So, according to our calculations, President Bush would have to had to read approximately 97 pages every day for 232 consecutive days to have mowed through a sixty-book reading list.</p>\n<p>Without getting into the academic research on reading rates and comprehension, let's just assume that the President proceeded at the straightforward and brisk pace of one page per minute. The simple 1:1 page-to-minute ratio demands more than an hour and a half of reading time each and every day. Two minutes per page? That, of course, doubles the president's daily reading regime to more than three hours every day.</p>\n<p>Now, far be it from me to judge anyone here, but assuming my math is right that's  a pretty steep hill for anyone to climb. My guess is that it's likely to have been a wee bit of an exaggeration.</p>\n<p>For anyone interested, here are the presidential book titles I found from before 2006.</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td

pages. If you divide that number by 365 you get 31.9, which is how many pages someone would have to read every single day of the year to finish all 31 books.</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Impressive enough, right? Does anyone here read more than 30 pages a day?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, remember, the claim isn't that President Bush read 31 books last year. No, the claim is that he read 60 books - and all of them by August 20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without knowing the complete list of titles, it's impossible to generate an exact page total. One alternative is to assume that the rest of the books were of approximately the same length as the titles we do know. The average length of the 31 books listed above is just over 375 pages. Since we're 29 books short of our total, let's multiply that by 375, which rounds out to about 10,895 additional pages of reading. That nearly doubles our earlier total of 11,647 up to an estimated 22,543 pages of reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick run through the calendar shows August 20 to have been the 232nd day of the year. What's 22,543 divided by 232? It's 97. So, according to our calculations, President Bush would have to had to read approximately 97 pages every day for 232 consecutive days to have mowed through a sixty-book reading list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without getting into the academic research on reading rates and comprehension, let's just assume that the President proceeded at the straightforward and brisk pace of one page per minute. The simple 1:1 page-to-minute ratio demands more than an hour and a half of reading time each and every day. Two minutes per page? That, of course, doubles the president's daily reading regime to more than three hours every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, far be it from me to judge anyone here, but assuming my math is right that's  a pretty steep hill for anyone to climb. My guess is that it's likely to have been a wee bit of an exaggeration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For anyone interested, here are the presidential book titles I found from before 2006.</p>\n\n\n\n<table>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td style=\"width: 457px\"><font size=\"2\"><strong>Title</strong></font></td>\n\n<td style=\"width: 121px\"><font

In his essay <a href=\"http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/patee.html\" target=\"_blank\">Politics and the English Language</a> Orwell wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>The word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies \"something not desirable.\" The words democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another...\n\n<br /><br />\n\n...One ought to recognize that the present political chaos is connected with the decay of language, and that one can probably bring about some improvement by starting at the verbal end.  If you simplify your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy. You cannot speak  any of the necessary dialects, and when you make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself. Political language -- and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists -- is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at least change one's own habits, and from time to time one can even, if one jeers loudly enough, send some worn-out and useless phrase -- some <em>jackboot, Achilles' heel, hotbed, melting pot, acid test, veritable inferno, </em> or other lump of verbal refuse -- into the dustbin, where it belongs.</blockquote>",

My intention isn't to be dismissive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And not to get too intense about it, but if two strongly opposed sides can each get away with labeling the other fascist without any clear contradictions, that means the battle George Orwell took up in 1946 has failed to progress much at all. In his essay <a href=\"http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/patee.html\" target=\"_blank\">Politics and the English Language</a> Orwell wrote:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>The word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies \"something not desirable.\" The words democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another...\n\n<br><br>\n\n...One ought to recognize that the present political chaos is connected with the decay of language, and that one can probably bring about some improvement by starting at the verbal end.  If you simplify your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy. You cannot speak  any of the necessary dialects, and when you make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself. Political language -- and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists -- is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at least change one's own habits, and from time to time one can even, if one jeers loudly enough, send some worn-out and useless phrase -- some <em>jackboot, Achilles' heel, hotbed, melting pot, acid test, veritable inferno, </em> or other lump of verbal refuse -- into the dustbin, where it belongs.</blockquote>",

It's off a brand new triple-disc mix of \"Madchester\"-era British dance music pulled together by Phil Beckett and New Order's bassist Peter Hook. Few scenes have milked their moment as long or as hard as these lads. (The first two pages of a search for New Order on Amazon.com display six different best of compilations.) But when the music is this soothing it's hard to complain too loudly.</p>",

I've been doing it more than two years now. It ain't much. I don't beatmatch or spin it.

   "author": 1,

On Election Day 2004, Matt Blunt defeated the Missouri state auditor in the open race to be Missouri's governor. Last night, the same electorate saw her name on the ballot again and this time chose her over incumbent U.S. Sen.

   "body_html": "<p>One of the buzzier pieces of reporting zipping around Washington right now is Joshua Green's cover story on Hillary Clinton in the November edition of the Atlantic magazine (<a title=\"You might need to be a subscriber.\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200611/green-hillary\">link</a>).</p>\n<p>It features some illuminating reporting about Clinton's ballyhooed success currying favor in the Senate (Any encounter with Sen. Byrd's deluded, unworldly self-regard is usually good for a laugh), but Green's overall thesis is flawed and telling about one aspect of the sickly state of political reporting.</p>\n<p>Here's how the story goes: Hillary was elected to the Senate six years ago. People were skeptical. But, according to Green, she's had as much legislative success as a first-term minority senator could expect, remains the preeminent political figure for both the Democratic party and all political active women, maintains a legal resume to match anyone, is married to <a title=\"From David Remnick's New Yorker piece\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060918fa_fact1\">the man known as the Michael Jordan of politics</a>, can and will raise more money than God, learned well from her political mistakes on Hillarycare, is self-aware and smart, but, yet, <em>somehow</em>, just won't cut it as a presidential candidate.</p>\n<p>Despite that whole laundry list, and despite the no-more-impressive resumes of most other presidential contenders (not to mention the past two presidents), Green concludes she just isn't big enough for the job. Despite being one of the Senate's leading critics of the Bush adminstrations war effort, despite prompting hardline foes to seek forgiveness for past grievances, despite winning over a New York electorate that was highly skeptical of the legitimacy in her initial campaign, and despite doing all this while under unmatched media scrutiny and a freshman member of the Democratic party's most politically impotent Congressional delegation in several generations, Hillary Clinton just isn't getting enough done for Mr. Green.</p>\n<p>A lot of people make rational arguments against a second Clinton presidency. Some Democrats look at the polls and say Hillary can't win. Many Republicans and independents look at Hillary's track record and say she shouldn't win. And most of the time they have solid reasons for taking those positions. They're based on reason and principle. You can disagree. You can argue against them. They're empirical.</p>\n<p>Joshua Green eloquently lays out and reports a whole array of arguments that do not support his main thesis, yet he fails to synthesize the facts in another way. Why? He reveals himself, inadvertantly it seems, when applying his critique to Clinton's rationalization of her vote to authorize military action against Iraq in the fall of 2002 and how she sees her position as distinct from that most unfashionable of senators, Joe Lieberman.</p>\n<p>Green quotes Clinton in full, lauds her for her elocution and poise, admires the nuance of her peformance, and then swiftly dismisses the substance of the argument. What's that sound like? The talent competition in a beauty contest!</p>\n<p>We see this approach toward evaluation again during Green's breathless recounting of how he briefly basked in the wake of Clinton's fame. Most of the time Green seems bored with Hillary the person, hiding, as he says, \"behind a screen of detail.\" It is when he observes her leaping on stage  with Oprah Winfrey at the International Emmys to the crowd's roaring approval that Green seems to regard her as most worthy to lead the world's lone superpower. He writes: \"It sounds corny, but it was really exciting.\"</p>\n<p>Like a lot of people who are passionate enough about politics to dedicate their career to it, Green displays a hunger for charisma, for a sense of authenticity in America's leader. He seems to be looking for inspiration, for a higher calling. No more compromises. The truth, at last. I've seen this a lot in young liberals since I've moved to Washington.  I've seen it in their muted admiration for John McCain's aura of integrity, in the persisting cult of JFK, in the rise of Barack Obama (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?guid=%7B26311CE6-68DD-4F88-B1FA-8398AB129374%7D\">See this recent beauty contest review from the supposed \"reality-based community\"</a>). But what they're searching for is as fleeting as the rush after a first kiss. Not only is there little reason to believe emotional attraction will inspire sound public policy, but we've got a century full of anecdotal evidence suggesting that it isn't the best way to choose who runs your republic.</p>\n<p>But if it's all about showmanship, if Green's way is how it's going to go nationwide, then Hillary is in trouble. It's clear. She doesn't make our nipples quiver anymore. The thrill is gone and there may be nothing she can say -- or broadcast a million times on television -- that will win us back. Whether you're for Hillary or against her, let's hope we're better than that.</p>",

Most of the time Green seems bored with Hillary the person, hiding, as he says, \"behind a screen of detail.\" It is when he observes her leaping on stage  with Oprah Winfrey at the International Emmys to the crowd's roaring approval that Green seems to regard her as most worthy to lead the world's lone superpower. He writes: \"It sounds corny, but it was really exciting.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like a lot of people who are passionate enough about politics to dedicate their career to it, Green displays a hunger for charisma, for a sense of authenticity in America's leader. He seems to be looking for inspiration, for a higher calling. No more compromises. The truth, at last. I've seen this a lot in young liberals since I've moved to Washington.  I've seen it in their muted admiration for John McCain's aura of integrity, in the persisting cult of JFK, in the rise of Barack Obama (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?guid=%7B26311CE6-68DD-4F88-B1FA-8398AB129374%7D\">See this recent beauty contest review from the supposed \"reality-based community\"</a>). But what they're searching for is as fleeting as the rush after a first kiss. Not only is there little reason to believe emotional attraction will inspire sound public policy, but we've got a century full of anecdotal evidence suggesting that it isn't the best way to choose who runs your republic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if it's all about showmanship, if Green's way is how it's going to go nationwide, then Hillary is in trouble. It's clear. She doesn't make our nipples quiver anymore. The thrill is gone and there may be nothing she can say -- or broadcast a million times on television -- that will win us back. Whether you're for Hillary or against her, let's hope we're better than that.</p>",

Grace Kelly <em>and </em>Princess Diana.</p>\n<p>I sent the magazine's managing editor, James Hughes, an email asking if his staff had put any thought into the matter. Here is his response:</p>\n<blockquote>Thank you for your concerns. Annie Nocenti, one of our editors at large, is a 20-year veteran of magazine publishing, and we trust the pieces she brings into the fold. We often have writers and authors expand on their personal interactions with their colleagues in print. In fact, we've devoted large portions of issues, like our \"Publishing\"\" (22) and \"Auteurs\"\" (23) issues, to writers/editors and filmmakers commenting on their collaborations with their colleagues. This is consistent with our editorial direction.\n\n<br /><br />\n\nIf we were a news source, this would have perhaps been handled differently. But we're an entertainment magazine. And we're independently owned and operated, so the outcome of Ms. Dawn's book or other such titles is not our concern.</blockquote>\n<p>While it's hard to get too worked up over a little magazine profile, I can't say I'm satisfied with Hughes' answer. Nocenti and the editors do deserve credit for disclosing the connection, but a small dose of transparency isn't enough to remedy my unease. The evidence of a conflict of interest creates a perception of the possibility of deception. Learning about their connection the way we do, it's hard not to be suspicious of the whole article being in bad faith. As far as I know, Dawn, Nocenti and Carter are best friends and political collaborators seeking to win me over with an air brushed portrait of their cause. On the other hand, I don't know that to be the case. Maybe they'd never met before their interview, despite the connection on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It Takes a Nation.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d There's not enough evidence available to pass judgment either way. My assumption is that Stop Smiling, despite being an entertainment magazine, aspires to instill more confidence than this in its readers. If so, I think this sort of thing ought to be of their concern.</p>\n<p>But that's just me. What do you think? Am I being schoolmarmish? I'm not the only one feeling queasy about this sort of thing.

Annie Nocenti, one of our editors at large, is a 20-year veteran of magazine publishing, and we trust the pieces she brings into the fold. We often have writers and authors expand on their personal interactions with their colleagues in print. In fact, we've devoted large portions of issues, like our \"Publishing\"\" (22) and \"Auteurs\"\" (23) issues, to writers/editors and filmmakers commenting on their collaborations with their colleagues. This is consistent with our editorial direction.\n\n<br><br>\n\nIf we were a news source, this would have perhaps been handled differently. But we're an entertainment magazine. And we're independently owned and operated, so the outcome of Ms. Dawn's book or other such titles is not our concern.</blockquote>\n\n<p>While it's hard to get too worked up over a little magazine profile, I can't say I'm satisfied with Hughes' answer. Nocenti and the editors do deserve credit for disclosing the connection, but a small dose of transparency isn't enough to remedy my unease. The evidence of a conflict of interest creates a perception of the possibility of deception. Learning about their connection the way we do, it's hard not to be suspicious of the whole article being in bad faith. As far as I know, Dawn, Nocenti and Carter are best friends and political collaborators seeking to win me over with an air brushed portrait of their cause. On the other hand, I don't know that to be the case. Maybe they'd never met before their interview, despite the connection on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It Takes a Nation.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d There's not enough evidence available to pass judgment either way. My assumption is that Stop Smiling, despite being an entertainment magazine, aspires to instill more confidence than this in its readers. If so, I think this sort of thing ought to be of their concern.</p>\n\n<p>But that's just me. What do you think? Am I being schoolmarmish? I'm not the only one feeling queasy about this sort of thing. Martha Bayne came down pretty hard in <a href=\"http://www.chicagoreader.com/pdf/060317/060317_ot_media.pdf\">a recent review for the Chicago Reader</a>.</p>",

You guessed it, welfare reform.\n\n<blockquote>We reformed welfare programs that however well intentioned undermined the dignity of work and personal responsibility and perpetuated poverty.</blockquote>\n\nMaybe it depends upon what meaning of the word 'we' is.",

They dubbed him \"The Hammer.\"\n\n<blockquote>I found that it is customary in speeches such as these to reminisce about the good old days of political harmony and across-the-aisle camaraderie, and to lament the bitter, divisive partisan rancor that supposedly now weakens our democracy.\n\n\n\nWell, I can't do that because partisanship, Mr. Speaker, properly understood, is not a symptom of democracy's weakness but of its health and its strength, especially from the perspective of a political conservative.</blockquote>\n\nAnd what does The Hammer claim as one of the chief victories of his take-no-prisoners brand of conservatism? You guessed it, welfare reform.\n\n<blockquote>We reformed welfare programs that however well intentioned undermined the dignity of work and personal responsibility and perpetuated poverty.</blockquote>\n\nMaybe it depends upon what meaning of the word 'we' is.",

When the magician Splendini (Woody Allen) stows her away inside a box for his grand finale, Johansson is visited by the ghost of recently deceased journalist (Ian McShane), who implores her to follow up on a juicy tip he picked up on the ferry across the River Styx. It would seem that one of London's most respected, and most attractive, young noblemen (Hugh Jackman) may indeed be the secret identity of a notorious serial killer. Intent on getting the story, but unsure of her own abilities, Johansson quickly enlists Allen in her quest to get the story.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in\">Don't expect much. It's a flip, disposable movie with a slack, disjointed script and lightly sketched characters\u00e2\u20ac\u201da tossed-off take on classic romantic mysteries like His Girl Friday and The Thin Man.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in\">But slack and quickly castoff is a fair way to describe all of Allen's work. Like his best films, Scoop succeeds when it yields center stage to the subject its director knows best: himself. Even at the age of 70, Allen can still capture your attention with his outrageous anxieties and gleefully nihilistic vaudeville. His banter with Johansson offers a low-wattage version of the urbane repartee that illuminates the male-female detective comedies Allen is out to imitate, but the roles are as ill-fitting to their players as dowdy glasses to Johansson's face. It's pathetic to see a beautiful woman pretend to be ordinary, and it's shameful for such a talented filmmaker to shy away from exercising his strengths. What it leads to is dull film with a few small pleasures, but almost neurotic in its self-repression.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in\">Despite the waves of empathy and adoration Johansson drew from young cinephiles and intellectuals with her minor-key performance in Sophia Coppola's Lost in Translation, it remains to be seen whether she can summon performances to match her ascendant stardom. Without a doubt, she's lost here, wandering unconvincingly through her paces as Allen's cross between Nancy Drew and Hildy Johnson. It's hard not to wonder whether her career would be better suited if she let her body do the talking instead of a voice that, for all its husky allure, she has yet to master.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in\">One of the more interesting developments of this film is Allen's newfound role as father figure to his female lead. His critics have been happy to take the opportunity to underline their relief that he's finally relinquished a romantic role (Mahnola Dargis of The New York Times damns Scoop with the faint praise that it has less pawing of young women than any Allen film in years). While we all need a good vent from time to time, it would be nice to see such bile saved for the people who deserve it, like the cynical liars and swill merchants who brought us the crime against enlightenment known as The DaVinci Code. A harmless old comedian playing out his fantasies seems such small game in comparison. Raising the blunt power of the press against so slight a film seems as cruel and unnecessary as robbing children of the pleasures they find in Splendini's simple magic tricks.</p>",

   "title": "Better Filming Through Chemistry", 
   "author": 1, 
   "body_html": "<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in\">In his adaptation of Philip K. Dick's <a title=\"Visit the Apple site to view the trailer.\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/trailers/warner_independent_pictures/ascannerdarkly/\" target=\"_blank\">\"A Scanner Darkly,\"</a> the director Richard Linklater has made a considerable achievement simply by conjuring images otherworldly enough to\u00c2\u00a0suit Dick's arrhythmic work. By recasting reality in an eerie, hallucinogenic haze, Linklater has set the stage perfectly to play out Dick's dark vision of a not-too-distant future where drug addiction and the technology of the police state have overtaken American society.</p>\n\nIt was all done using a technique called <a title=\"Click here to read a Wired article about how it was done.\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.03/scanner.html\" target=\"_blank\">rotoscoping</a>. After a scene is shot with a conventional camera, the stock is loaded onto a computer where graphic artists create animations by tracing over the footage. In the days before computers, a projection machine -- named, of course, the rotoscope -- projected live footage onto a screen for the animator to trace by hand. Back then its primary use came as a reference tool, an aid for animators to help simulate complex movements like Prince Charming's dance steps in Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\n\n\n\nLinklater caught a lot of attention five years ago when he put the new digital version of the technique (the software is called Rotoshop) to use in his film <a title=\"Click here to read the IMDB summary\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243017/\" target=\"_blank\">Waking Life</a>. His animators did more than just another trace job, instead splashing Linklater's shots onto their digital canvas and morphing the mundane everyday into a fluid dreamscape where our narrator's fantasies and longings could seamlessly float alongside his very lifelike movements.\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in\">Sadly, the frontier Waking Life opened has gone largely unexplored. Maybe the stoner philosophy at its center obscured the film's achievements, or maybe other people don't see the form's potential as I do, but, for whatever reason, Linklater's use of animation's dazzling new vocabulary failed to inspire other directors to try and say something serious; the only significant followers coming from the world of advertising, where <a title=\"Visit Slate to watch and read about Charles Schwab's \" href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2131287/\" target=\"_blank\">a brokerage house</a> and an automotive company picked up on the technique to give their products a fresh, eye-catching look.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in\">But, for all its sheen, Linklater's animation turns out to be just as dependent on his characters as his best conventional work (Slacker, Dazed and Confused, Before Sunrise, Before Sunset), which, for all its visual verisimilitude, has always hinged success on the ability of his actors to connect with the audience's empathy and compassion. As engaged and entranced as we might be by the hynopotic visual lure of Linklater's images, they remain, tragically, centered on the image of one Keanu Reeves, a man with all the emotive range and timbre of a slightly overcooked brisket.

   "body_markup": "<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in\">In his adaptation of Philip K. Dick's <a title=\"Visit the Apple site to view the trailer.\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/trailers/warner_independent_pictures/ascannerdarkly/\" target=\"_blank\">\"A Scanner Darkly,\"</a> the director Richard Linklater has made a considerable achievement simply by conjuring images otherworldly enough to\u00c2\u00a0suit Dick's arrhythmic work. By recasting reality in an eerie, hallucinogenic haze, Linklater has set the stage perfectly to play out Dick's dark vision of a not-too-distant future where drug addiction and the technology of the police state have overtaken American society.</p>\n\nIt was all done using a technique called <a title=\"Click here to read a Wired article about how it was done.\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.03/scanner.html\" target=\"_blank\">rotoscoping</a>. After a scene is shot with a conventional camera, the stock is loaded onto a computer where graphic artists create animations by tracing over the footage. In the days before computers, a projection machine -- named, of course, the rotoscope -- projected live footage onto a screen for the animator to trace by hand. Back then its primary use came as a reference tool, an aid for animators to help simulate complex movements like Prince Charming's dance steps in Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\n\n\n\nLinklater caught a lot of attention five years ago when he put the new digital version of the technique (the software is called Rotoshop) to use in his film <a title=\"Click here to read the IMDB summary\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243017/\" target=\"_blank\">Waking Life</a>. His animators did more than just another trace job, instead splashing Linklater's shots onto their digital canvas and morphing the mundane everyday into a fluid dreamscape where our narrator's fantasies and longings could seamlessly float alongside his very lifelike movements.\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in\">Sadly, the frontier Waking Life opened has gone largely unexplored. Maybe the stoner philosophy at its center obscured the film's achievements, or maybe other people don't see the form's potential as I do, but, for whatever reason, Linklater's use of animation's dazzling new vocabulary failed to inspire other directors to try and say something serious; the only significant followers coming from the world of advertising, where <a title=\"Visit Slate to watch and read about Charles Schwab's \" href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2131287/\" target=\"_blank\">a brokerage house</a> and an automotive company picked up on the technique to give their products a fresh, eye-catching look.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in\">But, for all its sheen, Linklater's animation turns out to be just as dependent on his characters as his best conventional work (Slacker, Dazed and Confused, Before Sunrise, Before Sunset), which, for all its visual verisimilitude, has always hinged success on the ability of his actors to connect with the audience's empathy and compassion. As engaged and entranced as we might be by the hynopotic visual lure of Linklater's images, they remain, tragically, centered on the image of one Keanu Reeves, a man with all the emotive range and timbre of a slightly overcooked brisket. While he certainly succeeds in emitting the abundance of one-liners Linklater's script provides with his signature quzzical grunt, sometimes even a well-delivered \"Whoa!\" just isn't enough, as the Matrix sequels and whole string of vapid romantic comedies have certainly proved.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in\">Instead the film belongs to the supporting cast, especially Robert Downey Jr., whose heady performance as the paranoid drugdealer Barris thrills with its tempering of Hunter S.

Thanks to a few good words from the indie press and his inclusion in <a title=\"click here to watch a high-quality quicktime video\" href=\"http://www.bravia-advert.com/commercial/braviaextcommhigh.html\">a popular Sony Bravia advertisement</a>, Jose, whose parents are Argentinean, seems to be making inroads in the States this year. The crowd was larger than I expected and surprisingly keen to see a frumpy European diddle around on his guitar for a most of an hour.\n\n\n\nI dig Jose's whisperish, Nick Drake-like sound, but his original compositions often leave me wanting more. I'm a melody guy. I like my songs sharp with personality and emotion. And most of Jose's tunes are, like Drake's, brief, elliptical and abstract. That's why I think his strongest performances come when he covers other songs. The Sony ad is a remake of <a title=\"click here to watch the video for the electrolicious original\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZatCZ1YWQeI\">a song called \"Heartbeats\"</a> by another Swedish band, The Knife.

Despite its anthemic chorus, \"Born in the USA\" is hardly a celebration of America.

   "body_html": "Somewhere in between coughing up Matt Cooper's emails and canning one of the best investigative teams in the history of American journalism, Time magazine managed to do at least one thing it can brag about. Reporter Tim McGurk and Aparisim Ghosh<em> </em>filed a report on the magazine's Web site on <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1174649,00.html\">March 19</a> questioning the U.S. military's official story on what happened after <a href=\"http://projects.washingtonpost.com/fallen/dates/2005/nov/19/miguel-terrazas/\">Lance Corporal Miguel Terrazas</a> was killed when his Humvee struck a roadside bomb outside the Iraqi city of Haditha on Nov. 19, 2005. The official military version back then was that the bomb attack also killed 15 civilians and was followed by an ambush of the U.S. convoy by insurgent gunmen. After engaging in battle, the U.S. forces claimed they killed eight insurgents. As we've learned in the papers these last few days, U.S. forces no longer make those claims.\n\n\n\nMcGurk and Ghosh's reporting, based on a videotape provided by an activist group and interviews with residents and officials in Haditha, gave voice to witnesses and survivors there who say that innocent civilians, including a number of women and young children, were massacred in their homes by rampaging American soldiers. The Time story led to an internal military investigation, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/26/AR2006052602069.html\">the results of which are now leaking out</a> through the newspapers. <a href=\"http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/story.php?f=1-292925-1674097.php\">Three battalion leaders have already been sacked</a> and the more we learn the uglier it gets. The body count has risen. The military is backing away from previous statements. And it looks like we may see a splash in the next few weeks when it all comes out. Who knows where this one ends up, but right now it looks like it has the potential to hit like another Abu Ghraib. Unfortunately, as it still appears to have been the case with <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A37679-2004Dec5.html\">Pat Tillman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/07/national/07LYNC.html?ex=1148875200&amp;en=cacbfa5983ac145d&amp;ei=5070\">Jessica Lynch</a>, the military's media machine seems to have been caught twisting the truth, this time covering up for what Congressman John Murtha (D-PA), an initial supporter of the war who has transformed into a vocal critic, is already denouncing as <a href=\"http://www.armytimes.com/story.php?f=1-292925-1808360.php\">cold-blooded murder</a>.\n\n\n\nAs constructive as the American reporting has been, it deserves to be mentioned that it might not have happened without a videotape shot the day after the attacks and publicized by an Iraqi branch of Human Rights Watch. I've yet to read any reporting on the cameraman, but it's being credited to an unnamed Iraqi journalism student. After all this reporting, I still don't know who it was. Has anyone printed the name? I'd think he or she deserves a little attention, at least within the journalism community. Somebody should <a href=\"http://bw.watchtan.com/article/54/skype-calling-to-iraq\">skype</a> 'em.\n\n\n\nYou can watch an edited version of the video at <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/IraqCoverage/story?id=1743981&amp;page=1\">ABCnews.com</a>.",

   "description": "What has not followed the drop in violence is a political settlement: for the past year analysts have worried that the failure to disarm or integrate the Sunni Awakening groups into the state risked sowing the seeds of a new insurgency. But the tepid response to the arrest of Mashhadani and other Awakening men suggests that a political reconciliation may not have been necessary. The burgeoning Iraqi state, embodied by Maliki himself, can simply continue to expand its power and crush any rivals. One US Army Iraq expert, who worked closely with General David Petraeus to plan and implement the surge, told me in 2008 that the civil war would end when the Shiites realised they had won and the Sunnis realised they had lost. Based on the conversations I had during a trip through Iraq last month, both sides seem to accept that this is the case.",

   "description": "Mrs. Clinton's and her closest advisers' turning a suggestion by the President-elect that she might, among other things, head the State Department into an \"offer\" and reports that she was agonizing over whether to accept it, did not please officials in Chicago, some of whom hoped that issues over disclosure of Bill Clinton's post-presidential record might block the appointment. But the former president's camp blocked that by promising to cooperate with requests for information and to accept limits on his activities, including clearance of speaking engagements abroad. Statements by the Hilary camp on November 21 saying that \"she's ready\" for the position but then backtracking, saying that some matters were \"under discussion,\" typified the whole mess, the only snag thus far in an otherwise unusually smooth transition involving impressive choices\u2014an object lesson to Obama (which he had reason to know already) that getting involved with the Clintons is rarely uncomplicated.",

    <p><a href="/">palewire</a> is built entirely with free and open-source software. The font-family is <code>"Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif</code>.</p>
    
    <p>This site's creation would not have been possible without the generous efforts of many people who do not know me,
    but who freely offer their work without expectation of repayment. Such is the Internet.</p>

<p>I would like to thank:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>James Bennett's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/coltrane-blog/">coltrane</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Django-Projects-Pratical/dp/1590599969">Practical Django Projects</a></li>
        <li>Jacob Kaplan Moss's <a href="https://github.com/jacobian/jellyroll">jellyroll</a></li>
        <li>Ryan Berg's <a href="http://ryanberg.net/blog/2008/jun/24/basics-creating-tumblelog-django/"tumble log design >tumble log</a> design</li>
        <li>Scott Wallick's <a href="http://scottwallick.com/portfolio/web-design/">work for Wordpress</a></li>
        <li>The responsive wonder of <a href="http://cssgrid.net/">cssgrid.net</a>
        <li>The immaculate sensibility of <a href="http://www.studioburbank.com/">Thomas Lauder</a></li>
        <li>And, of course, the entire <a href="">Django</a> community, without whose labors I wouldn't have a job, let alone a blog</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While it is certainly of less utility, I have published all of <a href="https://github.com/palewire/palewire.com">this site's source code</a> online, 
    where it is available to anyone who might like it.</p>

    <p>Thank you, everybody. That is all.</p>
